In terms of video quality I can confirm what another reviewer referred to as &#34;fixed patter noise&#34; to be an issue
These are some of her best shots
All of this in one camera
Awesome little camera that takes great pics
I was very pleased with the results
I can zoom in all the way and still capture a clear crisp shot of it
The incredible zoom and the quality of the pictures makes satisfied of this choice
With extreme shots, only very minor chromatic aberration and have not noted issues blooming
My A650 takes better pictures a significant percentage of the time and will continue to be in my camera bag until it eventually gives up the ghost
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
I love it
However, I really wished I would've done a little more research because I do keep in touch via social media with my family and this would have been a few steps easier to upload pictures had it had built in wifi like the Canon SX510
00 from Amazon- lens cover  & neck strap are good  quality- on-screen details help when using function dial- transfer  cable & software included- sharp photos with crisp colors- the impressive zoom feature works smoothlyCONS:- Only one
This Camera Horrible
Wanted to do a replacement, but this seller does not offer this exchange
I was very happy with this purchase at first
Doesn't feel real sturdy so I am still taking my older indestructible Kodak camera along in the rough places we ride which kind of defeats the purpose of replacing it
Most of them came out to be unsatisfactory
One other plus point is the start up speed - I would estimate at approx 1 second
I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
However, it is bigger than i expected, and I don't know if I'm a fan of the entire blue color on the pictures I print
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 is an okay little camera
I have had it for three weeks now and I am still finding new features
The print quality with the zoom is quite good
No one does true color better than Nikon, and its AUTO mode is off the charts spot-on, even for difficult shots in weird light with subtle effects (sun pooling through a forest canopy, for example, or dusk on a street as the neon lights come on)
Polaroids itself are affordable because they are built to be a bit less sturdy than a regular camera
Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm
Five Stars
Gave it five stars
1 MP- 60x optical zoom (it's true)- Accepts SD, SDHC and SDXC (just added a 64GB SDXC and it flies)- Rechargeable battery, AC charger, wrist strap and semi-proprietary USB data cable included- Small and light when compared to a full DSLR- Photo in all the formats you'd expect including 360-degree panoramic and 3D and with various preset settings, too many to mention in a brief review- Supports JPEG (DCF/Exif 2
big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
I decided to go with the Nikon as we already own a D60 and love it
It's a little bulky, but mainly because of the 1200mm zoom capability
Also keep these few things in mind based on the questions I've seen here on Amazon so far
I have not even tried all the features yet
I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
the camera is fairly intuitive and can be used without reading anything, but I HIGHLY suggest you read up on it and get the most out of this camera
So much in such a small package
The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen
The HD video is also super cool
Great little camera
It seems kind of flimsy and probably will not last
Good Camera
The 60X zoom is what attracted me to the FZ70
Easy to use  Small to carry on everywhere
We live in a rural area with lots of flowers and critters, and they are usually my subjects (unless our granddaughter is around)
I'm glad to report that Lumix have done a great job
8 in low light
I know whoever has this one is pleased with it
I am used to a huge professional camera, this is small compact and takes great pictures
The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark
Sure you have to keep super steady but i find that to be a huge advantage over the L820 which had not so great low light pics and suffered from blurriness
When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
The camera served me well for about 2/3 of the trip, but then the lens started to not close and the display showed a lens error
It is a little bit challenging to take a photo when focusing on something far away, but it is a matte of getting developing a technique
It can just be a toy, not a digital camera
However, when I look at the resulting shot, even those taken with the lens fully zoomed out, I see no evidence of the camera shake that I know existed
So, bottom line?  Excellent camera
0-Inch LCD (Black)Great features and amazing flexibility
$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
I've had it for a year
I have to change one
The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one
I'm in love
This is a great little camera
I was not expecting too much considering the extreme zoom and the price, but it takes very good shots even on iA
Outdoor/well lit pictures look good
Lots of choices and customization's available
Great for newbies
It's easy to make the photos
Not bad for a non professional or aficionado with a "multipurpose" digital camera
I've only had the camera in my hands since yesterday and will add more impressions as I get deeper into it but except for the lousy on/off switch I'm quite impressed at this point
if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
I do miss having a panorama option, but I find I tend to do a movie in those cases anyway
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light
I am trading in my FZ150 and replacing it with this unit
Just get out there and take pictures
This Christmas I purchased two items which were both trash
I like having backlit as a mode dial option
The camera claims to shoot 20-megapixel photos, and I'd believe it by the file size, however none of the 100+ photos had the crisp look when zoomed in to 100% that I expect for a printable photo any larger than 5&#34; x 7&#34;
I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
So when we got the camera, it had been opened, photos taken on it (digital ones) and you could clearly tell that the quality control  by the third party and amazon is not there
Sometimes the camera would be able to show me my existing pictures and other times it would not
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
So much better than my other cameras
With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one
Haven't found any large flaws yet
I'm not an uber-photographer but I know my way around point/shoot cameras
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
Got great shots with the with the telephoto and the shutter speed was fast enough to catch great animal shots
read the directions !
I thought the picture would come out at lot better
Great form factor and amazing shots
This is a camera that is not exciting in the respect that it doesn't have a lot of high tech bells and whistles but it does do well in the primary aspect in which you would expect a camera to perform well, which is taking nice photos
And it's not even noisy (grainy)
Nikon compact camera
Great purchase
Majority of pictures were blurry no matter what I tried
The display is great (or so I am told since I can't really see it)
They do not automatically credit your account
There are still some features I have to use
But, based on the reviews from consumer reports Nikon was a top camera so I thought I would try it out
The gold color is perfect
My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
Nikon coolpix L830
It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class
easy to use good price thanx
the only thin I wish was different would be a battery pack instead of 4 AA batteries
I don't think it's wise to provide so many shooting modes while it does not have a touch screen
No matter what the lighting is, it seems like every shot I take with this camera is blurry
turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
Can't download photos into android tablet
Every person who has seen it work is amazed
But with digital screen you can see and just take picture again under some light
Picture quality is great in good light
I really like this camera - for the price it's a good value
Plus here again, you can shoot your video with special effects
-The pop-up flash was really inconvenient
Also I found I really missed the articulated LCD that the FZ150 has
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
I love everything about this camera, quick and easy instructions for the &#34;how to's&#34; no film came with it, but I ordered it on amazon prime and it was delivered in 2 days
Am having a ball with it
To get more detailed instructions I'm going to try the Nikon website
I have a collection of truly impressive clear pictures that I only wish I could share with you
Back lit CMOS, where have you been all my life?
GoodThe zoom works wellThe camera is smallIt has a rechargeable lithium battery
A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
I also like the fact I can attach an awesome zoom lens for very close and personal pictures
the instruction sheet is in very fine print
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
we change settings and do all we can but the picture looks red through the camera eye and thephoto comes out red
Take the time to research the perfect digital camera for you, learn more on photography, and have a very enjoyable time capturing your memories
They looked better than all of my friends pictures by far and they had way more expensive bulkier camera's than I did
Really good for what it is
At the wide-angle end, the optics are unflattering for portraits (more than SLR wide-angles)
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
Battery life was good, and picture quality was great
It is a little bulkier than most of the compact cameras but the added features make this very compelling
I have owned this camera for about 3 months now and so far it is the best point & shoot camera I have owned and I have owned several
However, a little trial and error suffices as it is not all that complicated
I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot
There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem
Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
- takes pretty crappy pictures in bright sunlight
Five Stars
Battery has good staying power
This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
I tried the camera for basketball and soccer and maybe got 5% useable pictures, the rest were blurry
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
The Nikon S8100 should come with a written operator's manual rather than a software C/D that has to be viewed on a computer screen
A buying tip: If you are attracted to the latest, greatest model in a line of cameras but it's beyond the budget or has more features than you know you need, check out earlier versions of that model
My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
warning - i did read the manual !
It's a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one)
In bright light, the camera excels
Photos taken in daylight or bright indoor lighting display vibrant color and are very sharp
In order to store a decent amount of photos on the camera you will need to by a memory card in addition to the camera
after reading the review,  as was said only 2 things missing on this camera, wi-fi & moveable display
1- Small.
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
-I can control all the options i need to as a rookie
I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
I am also pleased by the controls, grip, and video quality
I sent it back
Easily fits in pants pocket
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
I think Nikon put a really good sensor in this camera, creating a balanced overall package rather than just inflating the megapixel and zoom rating the way some brands do
I know I've still yet to explore everything my Sony has to offer but I'm so proud to share the pix I've been taking with it pretty much right out of the box
In many instances just to make simple exposure tweaks you have to go several levels deep in the menu system
Sit in your pocket and take pictures
Would not function right out of the box
I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots
I also upped the rgb one notch toward red as well as the vividness it one or two notches depending on lighting
so why lie about it ?
I have purchased 4 of the former and 2 of the latter as I am coming to the painful conclusion that Panasonic has abandoned the high-quality image business
It is to me misleading for readers to see a 3
Great Point and Shoot
I needed a good camera to take photos of prom and other activities that my daughter has and this camera was truly great for that purpose
It took me a bit of time getting acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of the camera after having gotten accustomed to my Sony but since then, wow, am I a happy camper
The wheel on the back of the FZ70 is a huge improvement over the one on the FZ150
It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark
Just now able to use my new camera after waiting a few days to go buy another card so the camera would work
I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip
Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great
I also went to a horse show
is a good article, I arrive on time and in perfect condition, not to be a professional camera takes very good pictures, just make a suggestion, I include an external memory to the article
really nice for wide angle photos, which is why I bought it
i bought the fujifilm instax mini 7s for a third of the price and i'm much happier
Best camera ever
I know it won't be a Nikon
Great for zoom
) I also like the separate video button, rather than having to select "video" on the dial then press record
I was in love but now I am not
I was almost expecting it to be twice the size that it is, but that's alright because its now that much easier to carry without unwanted bulk
I bought this camera at amazon
but this camera is great !
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple point and shoot
you do have to purchase an extra sd card and more paper refills, but it was worth it
LOLIt really is a great camera
But I think photographers of all ages and experience levels will enjoy shooting with this camera
A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
Comes with multiple settings already programed and easy enough to play with other settings
for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with
Good photo quality, nice zoom
I did tons of research and finally settled on this one with the price range I had
we are very disappointed
The screen would show the error code "this card write protected"
- BATTERY LIFE: It's relatively, well, miserable
I read that you had to manually do the flash prior to purchasing, but I figured I would be okay with it
This is the second Nikon camera i bought in the past 6 months
It takes a 55mm filter size
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
The photo quality was top notch
3) Have to change the battery IN the camera
Very simple easy to use, lightweight, and it takes good quality photos
has met our expectations
The students LOVE watching their photos print out
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies
electrobrand lies, gives 0 custromer service, they just don't care
It's especially perfect for slipping into my purse to have for any kind of unexpected opportunity to take photos
Good camera for the non-professional
Before purchasing this polaroid I heard some negative reviews due to the &#34;chunkiness&#34; of the camera or the bad quality photos, although I have found no such issue
Great Camera
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
10x zoom is great for shooting the types of photo's I need to shoot
The camera has a solid feel to it
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
With that being said, the quality of pictures taken with the flash down are so that a little color/contrast editing bring the pictures back to top quality (sometimes better than other P&S; cameras with a flash)
From a Nikon D7000 DSLR user
It is not very interesting to zoom 100% or check pixels for this camera (or any other camera)
)The MAIN difference between the two is in the screen resolution: 460,000 dots for the T5 vs 1,040,000 dots in the T5i
Focus was fast, shot to shot recycle time was impressive, battery life was astounding (well over 400 pictures and the battery just dropped by one indicator on the 3-light battery bar)
Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features
It is very fast in writing, reading, shutter action, on and off, and preview of picture taken(Quick Option)
I am testing more features every day and will update this post with what I find
It is sleek & easy to use
The battery life is not very good
My husband and I travel quite a bit
I tried the IA and IA+ with this camera and took many pictures in different conditions
The shots out of this rival in color and sharpness that of my DSLR (when the dslr is shooting in
Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots
It weighed 2 pounds but had a beautiful lens
Love it
it is a very amazing product .
And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two
One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
Imagine at some point soon, it will end up belonging to one of my daughters
but that was what we were looking for
I could hear it during the process
I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with
This camera is awesome
I think that for the price and the quality of the pictures, this camera is one I would certainly recommend
As a 3D VXF hobbyist, I especially like the auto HDR mode and the bracketed modes
This is an awesome camera for the money
It is such an upgrade from my previous camera
Overall, very satisfied with this camera, would not have been able to get the awesome pics of the animals without the zoom
Easy to use with fabulous features of blink detection that makes ready everyone with open eyes
I was able to use it to capture my 2 year old son opening Christmas presents, and almost NONE of the photos are blurry, despite the fact that he was moving constantly
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
Excellent for the price
I did a lot of research before I bought it
The sound could be a bit better, but it's certainly not bad enough to complain
Love it
I haven't read all the instructions and have only used the automatic mode but we've been happy with the quality of the pictures
The audio is not as impressive, but it does the job
S graduation, just enough time to learn the basics
I could not be more pleased
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
Very handy when you just want to take a quick video without having to switch modes on the camera
This is an all around great addition to the amateur photographer or as a basic family camera
Another law of physics Nikon is unable to overcome, darn those guys again
i use it everyday and the pictures are amazing
The best camera, of course, is the one you have with you
Very nice camera
I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited
The image quality is not good at all if there is any kind of motion in the picture
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
grainy, cluttered, blurry
The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise
I was looking forward to using this on vacation but unfortunately was not able to
It is a camera for starters but it can't be compare even with an old Canon EOS T1i
On the other hand I can make it do more complex things
My previous favorite camera was a Fujifilm FX1, and while I still love it, I think I like this Panasonic slightly better - it seems to be easier to get a nice sharp focus
The menu system is laughably archaic but, it does the job
I know this sony wont let me down
-Sam
I've really enjoyed it
I won't waste time with too in depth of a review as there are already plenty of them
this is somewhat of a neutral thing because some people love them and others hate them
Rocky
we purchased this camera when we took a trip to Alaska
I LOVE the Nikon Coolpix L830
The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner
Bottom line is you will not be discouraged with this purchase
I was looking for the widest (24-25 mm) with good zoom in a compact camera
I miss my Nikon horribly but I do enjoy this little gem for about half the price
Took a shot of a full moon, blew it up a little on my software program and the craters on the moon showed up fantastically
1 desktop, then copying them to a thumb drive and trying to open the thumb drive in my tablet causes the photo program to instantly crash
Easy to use
Camera does everything I wanted it to do
The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use
You'll carry it with you every day.
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
It also rendered the camera entirely useless due to the inability to even sort through the functions of the camera to try and format the memory card while inserted in camera
Would you give up your Canon SX50 for the FZ70?
This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
Have not printed yet but am encouraged
I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
I've sent two back so far - any recommendations on the best bag for the S8100 are welcome
The zoom is amazing
Sony is a good name so Feel fairly safe that it will fill the bill
I like to buy a less expensive camera in case I drop it in a lake or off a bridge by accident, and this seems fine for the price
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
Great, great, great idea
Read all the reviews on cnet and it's definitely recommended
There are a couple of things I did not like
But just using the camera like I did with my old Panasonic, pushing the capture button down halfway until I see the green image box, I got some pretty good pictures
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
The action shots when the sun was still up turned out great and I was at the tip top of the bleachers still getting closer shots then my old 24zoom
Great Features but flash pictures are HORRIBLE
Sometimes it comes on and won't even show anything on the screen
While I have not had a chance to try out the camera very much, my impression is that it feels like cheap plastic, the viewfinder is tiny and grainy and the eyeglass correction lens frequently gets out of adjustment
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
Image quality is very good
very nice style
Loved this camera
Like it's predecessor, the Canon T5 is a no-frills DSLR whose primary focus is taking decent pictures
The picture quality is amazing
I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
The zoom features are awesome it will amaze you how good of images at max zoom even when hand held
Sony had great (most important to me) wide angle lens, good telephoto and the very great sweep panorama feature, pretty good screen images, BUT I was astounded how cheap and toy-like the unit felt to me in my hand
-Durable enough for me
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
NOW THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES
Taking pictures of stationary targets, the camera handles gracefully down to 1/5th of a second, which I find absolutely remarkable
also, the photo came out printed, there was no waiting for the picture to &#34;develop&#34; which is cool but isnt polaroid-ish
9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
really happy with this little camera .
but who cares ?
The features of this camera are outstanding from the fantastic picture quality to the extraordinary 60x zoom lens to the HD video
And going with a higher end G series would defeat the purpose of "cheaper and lighter"
It didn't miss a beat or even get a scratch
Nikon Coolpix S8100 Don't lend it out
Five Stars
My wife and I did a fair amount of research and we kept arriving at this particular camera--point and shoot w/ more than adequate zoom,mp's, and it takes a photo quickly--the major problem w/ old camera
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
BUT I REALLY LIKE
First digital camera
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
It went right back
I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person
This camera fits a unique niche
Picture quality has been very pleasing from macro to zoom - even on large PC monitor displayDownsides - no real negatives - I'd have liked the LCD not to be fixed but really just a quibble rather then a complaintExtremely pleased I upgraded and delighted with the camera's performance
Got super pictures in low light with no flash
I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic
I can't imagine anyone other than a professional photographer not being highly satisfied with his or her resultsc
I love it
High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders
Although the G3 had very, very good image quality and even great video (in good light), a m4/3 or DSLR is an investment item
This camera was way too expensive to have such poor quality
My wife loves the camera
Anyway, it may sound like I'm nitpicking but it is a pretty good p&s
*I also have the Z340: if you print a picture taken with the Z2300 on the Z340 it has much better color, so if you hesitate between the Z2300 or Z340 I can recommend the Z340
this is probably user-idiocy but I cannot figure out how to view/play images without the lens being engaged
The only real problem I had was filling up my 32 gig card too quickly
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later
I think the focus hunting condition with mine may have just been a condition of the unit I received but I don't want to take a chance on another unit
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
This camera is working like a charm
20% more coverage
Our son is due any day and I know she has been dying to make a scrapbook
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
The compromise is that it is a little larger but still fits into the front pocket of my Levis (it will fit in my shirt pocket also, but its weight makes it a little uncomfortable there)
When I opened the box I was initially shocked by how small the camera was
The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home
buy this camera and savour it .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
The camera is fine, but I ordered the wrong thing
(I could not compose properly in bright sunlight using the Nex 3)
The camera does have good zoom power but the picture quality is not what I had expected
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
Overall  nice camera with many excellent features
I ordered 2 Transcend 8g and 4G class 6 cards with camera
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
12 mp pictures will not fill up alot of space compared to 1080 video, so if you don't shoot video, the 4 GB card that came with it should be sufficient
This is the best camera have ever had
Easy to use and color image is fantastic
The aperture quickly drops as you zoom in on objects
In Manual mode the few available buttons have to pull double duty and getting everything setup takes some time
The body is still plastic but the materials are higher end this time around and you actually get a proper textured grip
Unfortunately, the flash head can not be turned upward which is a shame
I was so excited and it doesn't work
(1) my eyesight makes it difficult to manage
The features are mind-blowing
One thing that DSLRs do great is bokeh (keep one part of image in focus, while rest is unfocused)
You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter
When it came I was petrified to start all the things I had to do to really make it mine
It is amazing
I thought I was always going to be a Cannon guy, but found out differently
Bottom line, manufactures are missing the boat by not having more options with optic viewfinders  in their comoact models
 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
I liked the idea of a viewdinder and a hotshoe,both of which my nex doesnt have
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
I was not happy that the camera would not accept any of my 6 cards
Although the SX700 is a pocket camera, it is a little bigger than most small cameras including previous models (i
I've gotten some of the best pictures of my family from this camera
I probably bought the first Sony digital camera that recorded on floppy discs for $500 in 1997
People who drive think nothing of motoring over to the nearest photo store to get their camera's specialty brand specific sometimes even model specific battery
I'm very pleased with this camera
Let's me take the great extreme telephoto & wide angle shots with little WA distortion & minor chromatic aberration at extreme tele
Design choice of rechargeable battery pack rather than 2 AA lithium ion batteries; pack can not deliver full day of pictures; for whole day, one needs at least one extra battery pack, at $60 each
The best value, and the biggest zoom range of them all
I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
While disappointed, I guess I have no one to blame but myself
My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
so easy to use, its very comfortable in the hand, it feels quite friendly if that makes any sense :P  The rubbery spots are very convenient for gripping it and taking pictures with one hand
I wanted a digital point and shoot that I could use in the place of my bulky Canon SLR
So I am stuck with it now
me and this camera, we go everywhere
You just need to hold it differently than other cameras for the flash to pop up on the top left side, one handed pics (for right handers), no problem
Low light is very good for a compact, but don't expect miracles
Only draw back is its not water proof so now I have to get another after dropping it in the ocean
So far i love and i am an amature
but I would rather have it be noisy and fast, just to have access
the image quality is excellent .
Great for Shots on the Go
The only negative is the video capture is a proprietary Panasonic file type and you have to buy the conversion software separately to make your DVD's - but, that's not a huge deal considering how well the camera does both photos and video - awesome
I have a video camera for video
Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered
I love this camera
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
The included battery charger is larger!
I'll have to say that this camera has now taken over as my favorite superzoom
This camera is amazing
Bottom line is I AM VERY HAPPY with this camera
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
The controls were poor and very simplistic
And yes I used a tripod as well (which did help and got the rate up to 15%)
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
The three negative criticisms I have are that it saves RAW images as RW2
Yes, it is a fake DSLR
This whole camera was a mess
I wish I had researched a bit more to get the latest, but I had to have a replacement camera quickly
If you take a photo in portrait (vertical) orientation, you must rotate it MANUALLY
If you're looking for a high end camera but aren't ready for a DSLR (or if you have a DSLR and sometimes just want a simple point and shoot) then I would definitely recommend this one
We have 2 small children and the shutter speed had been an issue on the older camera, so we were hoping this would be an upgrade- unfortunately the speed was not much faster
10X zoom is wonderful
Poor construction, poor image quality
Good Camera for the price
Fantastic camera
I tried all the cards with the (card) slide switches in both positions and the S8100 would not function, only with it's built-in internal memory
Its a bit large and heavy for a point and shoot, but it still fits my pants pocket
Features = zero and the biggest issue I have with it is that it is incredibly latent
While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options
Check this one out for yourself for sure!
Don't get me wrong I love my Pro Canon EOS camera but this one is very easy to carry, up to date on technology, links to my phone, it's just a perfect all around point and shoot digital with enough manual options to make this semi pro photographer happy
I also like that the pictures are also stickers
the battery lasts way longer than any point and shoot
 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400
It is easy to use
Excellent purchase
Bought this as a Christmas present and the recipient didn't like the quality
way cool
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
pocket chainsaw
Great zoom, very good Continuous
Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either
I typically carry a Canon 40D and a 1DmkII but i wanted something smaller to carry around
Nothing is free these days but this surely comes close
Poor Quality Control, Lousy Customer Service
I need to find some time and just learn how
Otherwise LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT
But it is NOT the camera's fault, and the more I use this camera and the more I read the CD manual, the more I love it
It took beautiful photos when I was out west in Wyoming
I finally ended up returning after I looked a bit online and noticed that this was a common problem
I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
My only complaint would be no viewfinder
Super pictures and nice feature set all at a reasonable price
The price was much lower than the retail stores
Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing
I spent a considerable amount of time looking for a camera that I needed for a special use
To add insult to injury the software the camera comes with does not offer that either
Again, the picture quality is fantastic for a compact point & shoot
Great that you can pick and choose which pics to print
Easy to use
Both issues are easy to deal with once you know they exist
System reboot after system reboot held no change, and even trying fresh on a second computer had the same issues
I prefer adjusting the zoom by hand instead of the power driven zoom
added 2-24 .
Five Stars
It has many features and digital video recording at 1080
Nice
Great Deal Great Camera
I bought this camera as a replacement for my wife's Kodak Easy Share
It is definitely better than other high-end cameras that I have owned
It takes incredible photos, GREAT video and is easy to use
Love the T/W lens, the scene choices, etc
The camera body is solid/well constructed, grip is ok, a bit stingy on the left side (but I have small hands so not a deal breaker), & yes, the dial is stiff but doable
But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
Make sure you take the lens cap off before you turn it on
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
For the recent few years Canon has made great efforts to improve their travel-zoom compact cameras, and the new SX700 is their next remarkable achievement on that way
It is almost impossible to achieve zooming distant object without a tripod that is, if you want clear picture or movie without distortion but this isn't a camera's fault
We shall see come Friday night when I use it at my sons football game
I was nervous when I received it because my camera experience has been a smartphone
Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either
I love it
You can't go wrong
they stop time .
Happy with photos -- noted bright, deep colors
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures
takes a little practice for those of us used to larger cameras
WTF???Cannot believe Nikon came out with such a bad product
The mode dial (PASM) is tight requiring an unusual amount of force for this type of dial
It didn't have white balance meter, but still much more versatile than this thing
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
The photos it takes are of stunning quality
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
To get some decent pictures from our vacation I order the Disney photos, which could have paid for a new camera
I really dislike the on/off switch
I have yet to swap in the 1700 mAh spares I purchased, but hope they add a few exposures to what the supplied battery can provide
The touch screen/screen resolution made it nice experience
Love It
Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as "ILCE" ( "interchangeable lens digital camera)
Excellent camera that takes high quality pictures quickly and easily
No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment
The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
i love this camera .
I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom
Build Quality:Overall, the product quality is very good for this price range
And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord
This camera simply works for me
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
First off, the battery.
- confusing screen display
I just release it most of the time
But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money
In the stores it was $299, on sale for $249
I love it
I do not want to be confined to Canon software to annotate, organize, and store my photos and download via Wi-Fi
Delivery was on time as promised
Auto Scene works OK so far otherwise
If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
Zoom is awesome, shoots well in low light and movies are good for close-range
now what about the flash problem ?
I wanted something far more portable that did not require a camera bag when traveling, biking and hiking
The camera is responsive and is able to photograph kids at play w/o trouble
The Digic 4 processor is a fabulous processor and I loved it in my t3
I am impressed and cant wait to get more comfortable with it
Again, this is not simply a "point and shoot" camera, although much of the time you get excellent results just using the iA Mode (and altering nothing else)
I had been using an SLR from a competitor, and decided that it was too much for me to learn
Plus video is beautiful
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
my pda becames a digital album .
While it lasted, it was a great little camera
many before me have done that already .
But I am sure I will love using it
Happy, happy, happy with my Lumix FZ70
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
It seemed to recharge quickly using an electrical outlet but took a couple hours using the USB plugged into a laptop
The camera is easy to use and has loads of features
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
JUST CAME BACK FROM TRIP
Even with the max zoom the pictures turn out great
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
I think most people would not notice it
After reading several reviews that talked about poor image quality, especially low light images, I was hesitant to buy
for the FZ-70 that was 1200 plus the digital zoom
Great camera, upgraded from my Nikon Coolpix S8100 when it crapped out
my wife loves her camera - the pictures are of high quality and it was easy to use
Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
Very impressive
Works well for our purposes, but the memory and battery life is low and the pictures come out off color from what is shown on the screen
Besides, 720p video is plenty of resolution for me
Items to consider are: 1) the flash seems to be a problem since I normall locate one finger over the location of the flash
Zoomed in, the washed out look became even more pronounced
Bad prints
This seems like a no-brainer but but if you forget to do this, you can damage the lens mechanism
This is a cool camera
THis camera is significantly more weight in the hand
Awesome camara, and looks cute too
The salesman kept playing with it
Great camera smaller and lighter than a DSLR and much better quality pictures than a pocket camera
I ended up buying a Sony 14
According to dpreview
In other words, the photos are great for a sub-$100 camera, as long as all of your photos are taken in the landscape (horizontal) orientation
What the heck - can anyone give me some help here??I left on a trip after only having the camera for a week and hadn't really road tested it
I'll post a picture of a football gamein normal view then in 60x view when I figure out how to addcustomer photos
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it
Also it has a very quality and good looking finish
most of the time when you look at what you are going to photo thepicture is red
I've had enough of those tiny compact cameras now and I'm never going back
0-Inch LCD (Black)I had considered a DSLR, but thought that this model would probably do almost anything I wanted
Coolpix L830 camera
So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro
Good camera for the price
There are so many automatically correcting, errors features that it is well nigh impossible to NOT get a perfect photo
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
I've purchased two of these cameras for gifts and the recipients were delighted
it uses a MOS sensor which is much more accurate and clear than CMOS that is used everywhere
I have purchased two of these one for each of us as we like them that well
The camera in general has good performance in the speed area, although burst performance has only improved marginally over its predecessor
Although there are some modes I am still trying to get a hang off which come off a bit difficult to use
Meaning it can stand up better to heavier lenses
Lens quality is amazing with a 10x (300m) zoom and a nice wide angle 30m minimum focal length
Though it is still better (yes even the audio) than the Flip (any generation) or Kodak Zi8 & Zi10 for video
No Zoom Noise whilre Recording Video, Fantastic Purchase
I have a DSLR and I have a pocket camera
The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
if anyone has any good ideas for us please let me know
The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned
It actually takes a picture without flash (so as to capture the light behind you) and then takes a flash picture
I've never owned a compact camera anywhere near as fantastic as this camera
Beefy enough to hold comfortably in one hand and takes great pictures easy
Straight garbage i won't buy another Nikon product any time soon
Nikon S8100
My only disappointment so far is that you cannot shoot super fine quality in the &#34;auto&#34; shooting function
canon SX50 vs FZ70
Not sure how much video space that is as I have not taken any video yet (therefore have not rated the video in this review)
I took closeups at a ballgame and razor sharp without a tripod
If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
I love this camera!
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
I will informed all my family and my friends, so they will get one
Gee, thanks for wasting my time
Not only for the specifications that I wanted, but also, for the affordable price, that included accessories, this Digital camera
For this price, I cannot complain
So simple and we got fantastic pictures in San Diego
It's not worth 200 bux
I found the photos to be about equal to those of my 10yr old $50 Cannon pocket camera
The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom
I love this new camera and just started to use it when we went to our niece's wedding in Chicago
It failed at both
Very happy with it
I'm still getting to know how it works, so it'll be awhile before I become a novice
Will take a shot of one view and convert it into five or six other versions
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
I don't feel like dealing with returning the camera and waiting for a replacement, because I just want something I can use now
Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life
It compliments my Nikon D5000 nicely
Back to Canon
The picture quality is fantastic
As kind of a hobby, and to get out of the house for a little exercise for my 78 year old frame, I go to a number of stores to shop on a daily basis, mostly 7 days per week
How is it possible to build such a technological masterpiece and sell it for such a low price
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
I have used cannon and kodak and I have to say this camera is by far the easiest to use
I bought a camera the day i left the States to come out here, and it didnt even last 2 days
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
I have an NEX 7, and this was bought so that i could keep my telephoto on my neck while i had a wide angle
You wouldnt think it would get in the way, but i find my self often seeing the error "flash not fully raised" because my finger is blocking it
The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
However, I've used this camera on a family vac and really have no complaints about using batteries
Excellent price point for a camera of this caliber
Update on December 10, 2013:  After having used this camera for an extended period of time, I like it even more
Sharp image
(7) Quick startup time
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
I give this 4 stars because it is a bit bulky, the materials feel pretty cheap and it feels a bit like a toy camera
Returned it to Amazon and got a replacement
Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range
Includes some filters & frames on the camera itself
If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it
Excellent
digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
Yet, it is not overwhelming to learn
The capabilities of this camera come across as almost too good to be true
I went at Radio City Music Hall, in NYC, watching Madagascar Live, and I sat in the 3r floor, so far than stage, I put the zoom and I could see the face (all the details in their face) of the people and with my own eyes I couldn`t
Some people want to complain about the noise
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
The macro is so much better than my old camera (a small digital point and shoot, its a trooper, but very basic) I tested it out on some earrings and was able to get very crisp extreme closeups, with little need for editing
So far it is doing exactly as advertised
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
It has 2 panorama modes, 180 degrees and 360 degrees and they're the best I've seen
(almost)
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
I've resorted to keeping a rubberband around the body to keep it from opening
The new night shooting capabilities are the absolute best I've seen in a compact camera
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
Around 50c a print it's cheaper than film polaroids
Easy to use
Great camera
Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers
) Even with the zoom extended completely I am able to get decent pictures
The loss of one custom button makes this worse
But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
If taking movies, it can work for only less than one hour
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
Sticky backed photos perfect for scrapping
Nice photos
Great camera if youre looking for a hybrid between DSLR and Compact
Incredible sensor
The FZ70 is a bit bigger than I expected, but there's a lot of lens to house, so understandable
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
On very close up shots, we have experienced almost too much light
the shot looks perfect before you press the button but when it displays the photo taken, the light is so bright that the shot isn't any good and the photo does the same even when I decrease the exposure to the max
Movies, panoramic shots, close-ups and portraits are all wonderful
It feels great in my XL hands
Just shoot and click
I definitely recommend it
The panasonic does not have as long a zoom, but it serves my purpose and cropping  the final picture brings my subjects in beautifully
Most other reviews claim that it has a super fast, user friendly way to import your pictures to your hard drive
Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear
I like the WiFi remote control in this camera
I like to carry a camera with me at all times and this one was perfect
Camera arrived day before H
Photos taken in dim lighting requiring an ISO setting of 800 (or higher) are not very good
This camera replaced an S8000 I got a little more than a year ago that has most of the identical features and it took great photos too until the lens wouldn't retract with the same "Lens Error" message
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
I love that you can tilt the screen, it came in handy so many times
for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle
I take it with me everywhere,literally,
All of the shots are very awesome
My Canon EOS Rebel T5 - love it
The price is pretty reasonable and thank good the paper is much cheaper then the vintage polaroids
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras that you can buy today for under $200 don't allow you to adjust these things but really if you're serious about photography learning how shutter speed and aperture work together to create photographs is very important
Several cameras are as good or better performers, for less money
Love this little camera
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point & shoot that takes fantastic pictures, and has pretty good video capabilities with a good zoom, and is well built that will fit in your pocket
Bit harder to shoot at the long end, of course, but hand held shots can be done, which is amazing at that focal length
Has a separate button for movies; hence you can take a movie, then a photo, then a movie, etc
Once mastered, it should prove to be a very nice camera to own and operate
There isn't enough right up or videos about this camera but I literally watched every video by Graham Houghton on YouTube about FZ200 and that helped me to decide purchasing FZ70 as the features and functions are nearly identical in these two cameras
The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
Way faster than either of my Panasonic Lumix cameras
Great birthday present
UPDATE:One Month Later:  This camera needs a lot of light to perform at its best
You will not be dissapointed!
it takes 4 regular 2AA batteries, which I like, as its quick and convenient, and I was able to pop in my old SD card and get to work taking photos
One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like
I can also attach a wide angle lens for panoramic shots
I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
On the physical positive side the shape of the grip is excellent
Very nice zoom, now I can get decent pictures of my child's sports events from the sidelines
I'll keep searching or wait for a similar upcoming product to come out
If you enjoy "tweaking" settings this camera allows plenty of room to experiment
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
I have been having my T2 for some years now for sports photography
Great camera for the photographically challenged, stabilization is superb
I am not going to write a lot about specs because they are fully listed at Panasonic's site but maybe I should note a few of the features that made me fall in love with this camera
I always carry it in a protective hardcase
Nothing works
This camera is amazing
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
Dropping cameras is bad
I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
I have had a few Canon point and shoots that still operate fine and have never given me any problem
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
I like my camera
Feels like a much lighter version of my alpha 65
Not a professional photographer and wanted something easy to use and this fit the bill
Small, easy-to-use, takes great photos and is relatively easy to transfer to a PC
It took amazing pictures
It seems the past 3-4 years I have always purchased whatever point-and-shoot camera is on sale on Black Friday and I am always displeased with it within several months of usage and then buy another one the next year
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera that is simple to use
My only complaint, which ill agree with someone else on
Tests shots of clouds were better than average in that regard as compared to many compacts and P&S; models
I printed a few shots as 8
it was obvious that the Panasonic was not good enough, the Samsung NX2000 was on the edge, and both could not be compared to the DSLR
It's everything it promises
Takes great pictures
I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
I may come back and update more as I have more time with this camera
It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well
But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
Have a great and easy to use bundled software
Like other recent cams, there's face-tracking to try to get snapshots "right" on the first try
I don't use WiFi or smartphone functions
The camera is a great size and fits in her purse/pocket
OK
I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements
There were certain features I knew I wanted but didn't know if I could get them all in the same camera
There is a small pad for your thumb, but its placement just felt unnatural
It's not in the supposed condition
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
Though, these cameras are very similar in their class and both manufacturers have excellent reputations, there was a line up of subtle differences that were slightly &#34;improved&#34; with the Nikon Coolpix L830
I bought  this camera for the convenience of the video, but has been a dissapointment so far, I have sent it twice for repair (for me is a defect of this model, but check it out before you buy)
But being well within my price range, I couldn't resist buying it
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting
Photography has always been about compensating and adjusting
I guess after 65 years of using viewfinder cameras, I just did not adjust to having to look at the monitor
This camera has a rechargeable LI-ON battery, and this is an improvement over my older camera that uses AA batteries
You can still look at the files through the computer, but trying to move them or view the images results in windows explorer (Not internet explorer) to crash, causing you to be stuck on your desktop
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars-is because it doesn't have an automatic flash
Since I don't like using a flash, it's not a big downside, but I do want to point out that this camera really lags behind in this area
As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it
I liked the Samsung touch screen a lot but I have been hearing about far too many problems with touch screen camera so this one went down the tube after a short short
Lots of fun
I have my Fujifilm Instax so, I'll just stick with that
So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues
I have not used the video feature so can't comment on that
Low Noise
The increased functionality of having manual controls makes it more flexible than an automatic camera
I can't wait to use this on our Alaska trip, the reason I sprung for a new camera this year
It will cause a ring/vignette
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
First I have to say I am not a professional photographer, but an amateur that usually likes to shoot landscapes
Until I order that card reader, I have to use a friend's laptop which has a built in SD card reader and move files to a flash drive, and back to my computer, which is a hassle
It fits in your pocket.
The camera charged and came to life very efficiently
Turn it off.
After following all of their directions for mailing my camera (costing close to $20), I receive my estimate of repairs
Unsatified with picture quailty
I have used this camera for about two weeks now and I love this camera
This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get
This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting
I bought what I needed to be able to take pictures when I had to, but now I have a camera to take pictures because I want to
It was time to upgrade our Canon 5MP camera so after reading a whole lot of reviews, I chose this one
Both free
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
Excellent camera
It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot
It is hot enough to be annoying.
Recommend It
Great Camera
I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance
you will be very pleased with the images
1 MP sounds fantastic
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
Great for the price but lacks for video
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
this makes a great pocket camera
I am very happy with my purchase
But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range
I like the ability of just buying AA batteries and not being tied down to a lithium battery pack
Any input on this issue is greatly appreciated
At under $300 currently, it delivers great value
The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification
Perfect camera with a 10X zoom
He has had fun with this one
I got it now though
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
- Picture quality is decent
Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
A backward stepIt is still difficult to find functions in the menu system

Best Compact Cameras for zoom
This camera has all those bells and whistles that I wanted in a camera and so easy to use
] This camera is a quality product and I bought it despite, or because of the Ashton Kutcher commercials(I'm not too sure)
I began the review at five stars, but dropped it to three because of printing issues
Opening it is not too difficult, but the closing mechanism is a little awkward
The LCD has painfully low resolution
I'm very unhappy with this camera
The quick shutter speed if great for kids sports
I went to New Mexico for New Year's
Everytime you would take pictures of somebody wearing white, there would be a white glow shining in the picture
There is even the (very useful) option of a slower continuous shot mode
Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel)
For a non-professional it's ideal
(SanDisk, Toshiba, Panasonic and Lexar)
I did a lot of research on cameras before purchasing this one
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
It looks really cool- but the printed paper is too smal and the pictures are very blurry especailly when using the flash light
Included software lets you make a JPEG from movie frame
Cheap, light, good sensor, but that's about it
Also I noticed no zoom motor noise while watching the video
I do like the ability of having a separate button for videos in addition to the normal shutter release
Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me
I'm struggling with the lever that zooms the lens
There is also Av mode where the camera allows you to adjust the aperture of the lens while it handles the shutter speed
I absolutely LOVE this camera
The only slight compromise is that the video steady shot feature is not quite as good as you would find on a high end consumer video camera
I am not a photographer so the point and shoot works great for me
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
By all other reviews they rank these two camera's pretty close and that would've sent me the other way had I done my research better
I can throw this in my backpack and take it anywhere
Really amazing, my expensive 60D doesn't do any better even though I am using the viewfinder and holding the camera steady against my head
Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
very large pics take 8mb each !
I am ever so pleased with this purchase and the photo quality is AMAZING
I wanna go shoot something
The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing
It also takes 720p video which is always nice
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
This was purchased as a gift
I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus
I even dropped it down a 10 foot cliff with me behind it and it worked fine after the fall
Got great pics with the zoom
It only shoots at 3
Not too hard to steady with image stabilization, but with practice I will get even better
the only annoyance is if you happen to turn the camera with the lens cap on, it displays a message and won't go away, even after removing the cap
)(1) ISO speed, which I change VERY frequently, requires going into the menu to change
quality great an every light weight
With the zoom, I got all kinds of great photos of the animals from a distance, very sharp too, some photos look almost as good as my husband's digital SLR with longer lens
spec looked great until i took pictures, very poor at best, my 10 year old nikon d50 takes better pictures, the video has lines all over it and breaks down in many areas, overall build quality was totally cheap, spend the extra few bucks and get a canon t3 or nikon 3100 both work great, i actually bought a used nikon d5100 from amazon because i already had lenses which helped keep the price down, i don't know about mirror less tech but the live view on the canon and nikon works great, as many have noted the viewfinder and lcd on the sony are useless- love sony products , this does not live up to their reputation
Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal
Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going
The 10mp camera is great but don't expect much in low lighting
Horrible quality
I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
It is a good product and we are enjoying using it
, then I think this FZ70 represents the current "state of the art" in affordable bridge cameras
So I think I'll keep it
If it washes out, Move Back,and Zoom In a little to Compensate
He verified the FZ60 has the Leica lens, but it "appeared" the FZ70 did not
My wife enjoys taking videos when we travel
actually, I like the L830 more
This camera is not what I expected
Took great pictures
This year I came to terms with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment and decided I would buy a GOOD camera because it is worth the extra $50 or $100 to have the fantastic quality
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
They are working fine, but Duracells seem to be more predictable
June 14, 2014I took this camera on a month long vacation and took about 250 photos using all the program settings
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
The camera itself is light and feels solid
I had to send it back to Nikon for repair, which they did because it was still covered by warranty
at a price I could afford
It does have good battery life, as I was not able to deplete the battery on a 3-day trip with probably 100+ photos taken
I also like the lens cover
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera; it is very easy to handle and simple to use
I love the option of taking videos
I recently bought this to replace a Lumix G3
I've been a Canon fan for years and we have two others besides this one
The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
Otherwise the size, controls and handling of the camera were fine
If only it could fit in my pocket
Nice Camera, full HD pics and Video, not as heavy as las lumix versions
Not even close to a D3, but I wanted a camera to leave in the car all the time
overall it is the best camera on the market .
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face
The 60X zoom is amazing
This was a good purchase
I have taken very good care of this camera
Holiday Gift
And the cool thing is you can get a lot of different lenses relatively cheap for these Canon cameras
It will not take pictures, &#34;Lens Error&#34; comes up whenever I turn it on
The lens and screen are clear as a bell, the telescopic movement is swift, the video is marvelously simple to start and stop, viewing the video is clear and the sound is super
The zoom is fabulous, and most of the time, I didn't have problems with blurry zoomed photos
Read the manual, you'll learn a bit about the options (still have to figure what the 16 panel speed shot mode is about)
It ran on batteries so after taking about 1100 pics on a trip around the world I passed it on to a friend who is still using it
I rather liked the old lazy way of the auto flash happening when I needed it
This also has some bearing on the night or low light pictures taken with the S8100
I know it's a lot to ask from an entry-level camera, but even for basic use I am not comfortable with a camera that seems to miss 2 out of every 3 shots
The placement is absurd
I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
This review is based solely on my experience with the camera
I mainly bought the camera for its zoom and it hasn't failed me yet
I like everything about this camera except one thing
Not very good
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
The majority of my pictures are nature - birds, flowers, scenery
The 10x zoom is more then enough, I mainly use this camera to take everyday family pictures so the zoom does not get used much
Focusing: yes when I zoom in and try to focus closer than the lens physically can get it won't focus (10x has to be something over 10' or so)
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
Fits a man's hand better
huge plus
Great camera
Full daylight, light fluffy clouds and again shooting well below the full 60x (1,200mm) zoom of the camera and the results were horrid, grainy, full of noise
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
I lost so many lens caps in the past:{One tiny thing I am not crazy about: having to pop up the flash
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
Tough to beat
I like AUTO+ because you still have control over some items like exposure
Worth every penny and easy to use for the novice
Very poor picture quality
The video is very good although not great
Who knowsÖ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
Because the t5 is just a beefed up t3 I can use the same batteries, SD card and battery grip I had for my t3
Great little camera
Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
It's RIGHT where your finger goes for how you would naturally hold a camera-It's really heavy for a camera, so it's difficult to just throw it in a clutch or carry it around-It's oddly shaped, and I was never able to find a camera case for itThe good:-When you do manage to get a good shot, it's a REALLY good shot-It's great outdoors-The zoom is amazingOverall, I would not recommend this camera
picture this :
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
Awesome
I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash
Side dug out my window mount because you must have a steady mount if you're going to take pictures at high magnification
I'm finding this to be quite untrue, and it is unlike every camera I have used in the past
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
Given the quality of the photos and video I am shooting with the SX700, the effectiveness of the image stabilization, and the camera's portability, I don't hesitate to take the SX700 when going out for the day or traveling
The zoom is INCREDIBLE
Excellent camera
Have taken several pics in last 4-5 days and besides at first not knowing much about the camera it has done a great job as I learn more about all its abilitys
These photos demonstrate shots from very slow motion up to very fast motion
These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever
Very user friendly
It is easy to use, easy to hold and the moveable viewfinder is great
before they are sold out !
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
I am still learning how to use it so I will have to give it a little more time
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
Kind of flimsy and picture quality is not amazing but it's fun to have for a ladies night or fun date night
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
It is light-weight (Compared to my D300) and has a wealth of built-in controls to handle a variety of picture taking situations
The photo here definitely doesn't do it justice
That is not a deal killer for me
The continuous shooting is not as good as my DSLR, but still very acceptable
Love the Camera
I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS
This is only the first day of using the sx700 but it's performance has been impressive
All is good with this camera except for the usb, battery and hdmi outlets
Gives instant photo reference to add to journals for art, travel,  and scrapbooking
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
All about the zoom, baby
I never sent it it to get it &#34;repaired&#34; for a whole 200 dollars
now where did i put that manual ?
Bottom line is that this camera takes exceptional pictures, but as far as its overall performance, it is trying to fill a very awkward nitch in my mind
On the other hand I am completely in love with the camera, it's cute and has good quality :-D
One single lens covers 20mm-1200mm equivalent and  Full 1080/60iHD Panasonic Video recording with auto focus
BUT it was easy as pie and I am snapping to my hearts content
Nikon L830
Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7
I compare the Canon and sony cameras with S8100 and I can say that this is a clean win for Nikon
I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
I am surprised others have not mentioned this, though perhaps I received a defective unit
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
My husband, the photographer, is enjoying learning how to use this camera after having used Panasonic cameras through the years
I took picture 384 then tried to turn the camera off
The pictures are sharp, extremely clear
I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
Perhaps I need some time to study it and experiment, but I am disappointed with the picture quality
takes excellent photos .
5- Excelent software package.
Coolpix S8100 camera
excellent camera, the zoom is amazing, plus its effects on photographs very useful, I am delighted with my camera, I recommend
We decided to go with the Nikon because of the 1080p video, cmos chip for lowlight shooting and 914k pixel LCD
I do not know if this just affects my sample
Best digital camera I've owned so far
The pictures were very soft (fuzzy), not good detail at full zoom
This camera doesnt zoom but I was able to transfer my SD card from another camera into this one and it printed the zoomed in photos
Nikon S8100
I don't really care about this, but it's kinda fun and is a bonus
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
The start up time on this is amazing
I gave my daughter this camera for Xmas and we love it
Seriously Nikon?  Put a viewfinder in this camera and it would get 10 stars
I am older and cannot use anything complicated and I find that this meets all my needs and is easy to understand
HD video OK, quality of images better than waited, it's a great camera, good size, good value
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
Being disabled I can not drive, trust me I tried driving and lets say everyone in Maryland breathed a sigh of relief when I renewed my MTA Maryland Disability Transportation Card
