Fun camera, not a fun amazon experience
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
Love it
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
Very nice initial impression
Will keep working with it but don't think this should have to happen
I used POGO 2x3 papers (cheaper) and the premium photo papers (expensive) and can not tell the difference between the two
It has a slight darkness to it but it has an option to brighten your picture however, the image looks distorted
Good grab and go camera
I downloaded to may tablet and read a feature and try it on the camera
This camera is well worth the price
the quality of the pictures is so inconsistent
night mode is clear as day .
A great point and shoot
after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
So, now I have put out an additional $104 for them to correct the problem (that they are saying is impact damage, yet it has never had any impact)
what a dissapointment
I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port
This camera takes series of photos and processes the best image
For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat
If I had known more about photography and could have set if for manual settings, I might have done some better, but overall quality of the pictures was amazing
Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing
Would highly recommend getting one
The wheel at the back is OK, but not as inituitiveFPS is slow
Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
Great point and shoot
Sure, it has a few things that could be better (more control over continuous burst speed, slow down the shot speed on the 16 shot mode, better video setting controls, maybe put the flash 1/4 of an inch to over) but if they fixed all that, it would probably sell for 400 bucks
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
The shutter button didn't work
It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office Ã± where no one goes but me.
Even higher ISO were less noisy than some other camera's in the same price range
While this camera has 16MP like my other micro43 cameras (OM-D EM5, GX7, so forth), they are not in the same class, so don't compare this camera to any mirrorless interchangeable or DSLR
It's also easy to download photos - software was easy to install and easy to use
The photo quality is amazing.
If for no other reason, this camera gets 5 stars for the zoom
Replacement Camera
very poor quality
So, why the strong rating for a point and shoot Nikon?1
The zoom on this camera is amazing, the pictures I take using the 34x zoom are clear and crisp
You can learn how to work with the flash but it takes adjustment and fidgeting and you can't just expect to take good flash photos out of the box
- Exposure compensation button has been removed - its now difficult to find and use
I highly recommend this model
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
flaws ?
I also liked the zoom lens - it works well
The picture quality is excellent and the camera well balanced
I thought it would help me get great shots of the kids doing their sports, music performances, etc from my seat far up in the stands
I will return to using Canon cameras as they are more durable and of higher quality
I found out it will not work with iPhoto or Aperture as of this date,maybe in the future
With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions
I don't mind the cheap plasticy feel of the device nor the rather limited feature set compared to most other point-and-shoot cameras
probably 1 in 5 is good
this seemed like a really good compromise .
Not even an average picture in the lot - everything comes out stunning - beautiful color, sharp images with a perfect focus
Color is great
I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
The T5 has a fixed screen like the T3
I think the manual features available also make this a real competitor to a small lens, entry level DSLR
Slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor SX280
In the end I decided to go with the Nikon and I was not disappointed
Really like the different ways it can be used
My eyes are over 40 years old (the rest of me feels 29) so I have some trouble seeing up close
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
I am not sure ,but think some of the difference is lens quality between the two cameras
It's a nice camera
I should have practiced more before leaving home
Low light video also very good, but there is one setting in video the 1080 without the star where the video looks dull
Good quality and fun!
First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
I need to find some time and just learn how it works
While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
There are alot, I mean alot of variables you can do with this camera, but if all your interested in is point and shoot then it does that very well as thats all my wife is interested in
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model
Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000
We live in South Texas, and have not yet, explored all of what Nature has to offer
You can find those images at the Users Gallery above
The main complaint I have is the picture quality
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about
But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
Most of the icons in the manual as well as on the camera are meaningless?
The palm of your hand makes full contact with the camera
Besides, the thing that matters is the output
I wanted something to be not to small nor too big, and I think this camera is just what I was looking for
The camera focuses very fast
Zoom Framing Assist - very useful new feature to compose your pictures at long telephoto
Easy to operate and hold
Needed one for a family member that is getting elderly and cannot work his SLR anymore
The camera itself shoots much better pictures than the screen shows and prints are pretty true to color
I love the camera
This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this
Both the 820 and the 830 came with neck straps so hopefully they'll fare better
The main sacrifice in quality is in the LCD and EVF (electronic view finder) which have lower resolutions
The placement is very awkward
Basically, I downgraded to a point and shoot with a super zoom 3 years ago
I'm glad I bought it
Shooting in RAW format is great and works well
The fast shooting takes some getting used to
Once on the proper setting it does take a great photo but I'm not sure I want to be so committed to the thing as to have to take a college level course to learn how to use it
This is a great camera
The photo and video quality is excellent
and does very well in low light
I miss having a grid,may be
If u can get this kit cheap, or camera, like for $170, then yeah u have yourself a deal
I would be the first to say, "Canon has done it again," were I not also an owner of the ill-fated sx280
Horrible
I think I should have went with a 8Gig SanDisk Ultra PLUS  that had a faster transfer rate
Thanks for the input on the past gens that helped my purchase decision
) And the price was reasonable
This camera is great, easy to use, you can take pictures and also HD Video, which is just amazing
Problems solved
Of course there are some issues if you &#34;pixel-peep&#34; at the image 1:1 on your screen, but that's not how the image is going to be viewed
Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16
It doesn't explain the different modes at all, and gives no tips on getting good shots
Also, the door for the batteries and SD card feels a little flimsy
Currently, it can't be beat
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top
Obviously I didn't expect much, but I am very pleased
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
Excellent picture quality
It will be awhile before I get to use all the features that this camera has to offer
The flash pops up where you put your finger, but you get used to it
The pictures look better on the computer than they do on the screen
It feels like a high end camera and doesn't have that cheap plastic feel
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
First Rule taking photos With A Camera, Have One
I stepped outside and just snapped about 4-5 photos before coming in and downloading
Again I only used it for 3 days, so perhaps these features were overlooked, but at the least I can say that finding them was unintuitive for me
Much easier to use than my old film-version Nikon of technology from the ancient past
NOT even 1080 x 800 resolution
Love love loveeeeee
This bridge camera is not 'cheap' in any way except maybe for the price when factoring in the value it provides but, as a bridge, it may underwhelm those who have used DSLRs for years while 'point and shoot' users may find it too big, too complicated and probably too expensive
Love the tilting screen and the pic quality is very nice
Videos are NICE
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
The NEX 7 is a must have
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
Heavy emphasis on connectivity options using wireless, canon online services, NFC, direct print to canon printers
This is a next gen camera so it should do all of that stuff well and it does
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
some of the great gains over g2 --
Kinda makes sense, but just a slight inconvenience because you need to remove the lens cap first, then turn the camera back on
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
I bought this to use on a trip to the Amazon to spot animals, figuring I will need the zoom to take good photos of them up in the trees and in a distance
But after a gorgeous sunset that i caputred with 7 shots and fitted to a panorama
We purchased primarily because we were heading to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks for our honeymoon and wanted something that could zoom (30x) far for those distant shots of potential wildlife
Finally purchased FZ70 and quickly verified how great was the power zoom  beyond the optical range at 132X
There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots
Don't hesitate to get this camera
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
I put it on par even with the Canon T5i
The T5 is lighter
Daughter's First  Camera
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
This camera is a bit bulkier than the average compact camera, but worth the size due to all the features
Holding the camera still at maximum zoom is always an issue - you need a tripod to get a clear picture, but when the conditions are right you can get that perfect shot with this camera
it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
Images were frequently washed out and had a soft appearance
Night Photo is amazing
they look fantastic .
The camera's sensor is on par with a 2009 cell phone camera; granted, I didn't expect stellar images and in no way was this intended to replace my DSLR, but I had hoped that images viewed on a computer would be at least decent
Love it
I think I'll stick to Canon's from now on (my two Canon SLRs (film and digital)still work beautifully)
Awesome 30X optical zoom, fast processing and lots of features
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
I wish the wide zoom (30mm) was better but it's ok
After using a Canon for a number of years, I was pushed away from Canon by the fact that their newer cameras have an unusually slow continuous shooting mode
We bought this camera in anticipation of a trip to Alaska,  we are thrilled with the ease of use and quality of the photos
I can't return it because I am leaving for the Grand Canyon next week and will not have time
But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
A new high-resolution 922K, 3" display
* Almost the same battery (NB-6LH) as for SX280 (NB-6L) - old one works fine
I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
For the last few years, I've relied on my Pansonic Lumix F27
The color is always perfect
Have been using it for wildlife and birds recently and the zoom makes for some great photos
3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
Upgrade From Canon SX280; Very Effective Image Stabilization
I love the one button on and off for the video
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
I concur with the majority of the pros I've seen in other reviews, but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers:- TOKEN GRIP: While I'm sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors, it's still hardly a grip
The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted
I don't miss not having a viewfinder, which I thought I would
This is the camera for someone on a budget but they want bells and whistles
The zoom is great, and the auto focus works better than any point and shoot that I've seen
Great camera
My example of the FZ-70 took noticeably soft, blurry pictures particularly at the end of its zoom range
for the money this is a deal
The pictures come out remarkable
This is my third DMC-series Lumix
I like the view finder - sometimes it works better than the display - especially in bright light
) But that benefit is completely eliminated by the fact that the pictures are blurry
is the flash placement
It takes great night pictures and video, still checking all the extras out
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
waste of money
Highly recommend this item as a tool or memory captured moment
im not a photographer, but i think the pictures come out pretty well
Best camera I've ever had
Couple of nice features
My son absolutely loves his camera
Unbelievable performance
I have an FZ200 and am very pleased with it so far
You really have to check out the creative shot feature
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
It takes sharp pictures, is easy to use and lets you via the viewfinder electronically or the LCD
Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
All the different features are wonderful
The functionality was great but that's not the most important aspect of a camera, photo quality is and I just wasn't happy enough with the results and returned the camera
It is VERY noticeable and renders the beautiful looking video just about useless
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
For price, image quality, flexibility and ease of operation they can't be beat
very easy to operate
The 30 optical lens is awesome with an option of as high as 120 digital zoom
They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen
again all in-camera
When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded
So far this is worth every penny we spent on it
Also, the auto mode really doesn't handle the flash gracefully--you need to fidget with things to get sharp photos
Feature-rich, user-friendly, and captures excellent images
One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access
Nikon has an update (version 1
My experience with the 280 really shook my faith in Canon but I decided to take a chance with the sx700 in hopes of getting essentially a 280 that worked
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
Inexpensive enough to be great gift for young people
Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
Just get familiar with the menu and settings
The second big difference is the battery
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
I would advise anyone who intends to use this outdoors, or who doesn't have rock-steady hands when shooting without a tripod, to look elsewhere
Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
If you are used to automatic switching, it should not be a big deal to go to manual because the switch is within easy reach of the thumb
Camera is great for nature photography, The camera has excellent Macro capabilities
It's very easy to use and looks great
I just took approximately 550 pictures of a variety of different subjects: owls, sandhill cranes, ducks, blue heron, butterflies and some superior sunset shots and my ability to reframe shots, focus and change angles almost instantaneously allowed me to take numerous shots that I might have missed with another camera having a slower focus capabilities
Great pix
Really great camera
and then stick it where you want
I couldn't see the point in getting another t3 so I read up on Canon's other models
I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
I has a very easy to sue Panorama option
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
Once I picked up my SD card, I really went crazy snapping shots
"meh" interface
The photos are just breathtaking and better than anything I've ever seen or was able to accomplish with any other camera
It shipped fast
The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
I could be at fault on not understanding how to use the burst feature, but not with the poor quality of the zoom
Great camera-just what I was looking for and at a great price
The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built
And well is a Nikon, the shots are extremely crisp and clear, very easy to use, specially in the auto mode
This camera takes quality pictures for its price point
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home
Save some money and buy an EOS T5i
So Fun
I have to decide whether I'm going with the FZ60 or a Cannon
First the tilt able screen is an awesome new feature for those low to ground shots
Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great
Now the Amazon guarantee is not in effect, and when returned to Nikon, they replied that this is not covered under their guarantee (surely, because this problem happens so often to their cameras that it wouldn't be worth it)
Very good image quality/Good feature set for the price
You cannot compare a high-end semi-pro camera with a point and shoot camera with a fixed zoom lens
Not nearly as good as the original camera, even though it is digital technology
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
Sometimes detail with noise is more palatable than loss of detail and less noise
Love the 3D settings, the panorama settings, everything
This camera can't be compared to DSLR's but rather is a good bargain in a bridge camera
She points and shoots and it is perfect, from outdoor action shots to indoor birthday parties in low light
at this point i would not recommend it to anyone
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
So all in all I am very pleased
The video is also great just be sure to get a class 6 SDHC card or better and change the options to HQ video and pics(for some reason Nikon defaults to the lower quality)
Panasonic has been making these things forever, so they really have that down pat
Problem with edges
I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
Volume could be loader, so you can hear the stereo sound better
i 'm very glad i did .
What a great compact camera
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
It shoots nice pictures
Most of my indoor shots were without flash and came out wonderfully
Truly happy with my camera
Same goes for "night landscape" mode
Met all my expectations and more, even impressed my friend that such a small camera could take such nice pictures and be so versatile
There are only a couple of minute issues I have with it overall
Enough has been said on the reviews to add my comments in any detail, but overall this is a great camera - great photos so far in a variety of lighting conditions
It is a little larger than our old SD700 IS but fits in the pocket and takes better night pictures
When using zoom it doesn't take clear pics right off
Great Point & Shoot Camera
very cheaply made .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
It is bulky to use and the pictures all come out with a yellow hue to them
Its difficult to navigate through the menus, but everything is basic enough that if you just play with it, you'll figure it out
Quality is amazing
a big plus in my book .
Best camera I've ever owned
I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps
400$? Really? Sony is surely losing money on this camera
A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
I'm a bargain shopper
Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range
I sold my Canon A640 and replaced it with this and I am very pleased with the sharpness of the photos
It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around
Colors were all off
Original review:The FZ70 seemed really exciting on paper, but in reality the picture quality was disappointing
It does not compare well with DSLRs that I've used, but that is an unfair compariso
I wouldn't want anything to happen to this camera
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
Bought this camera about a month ago
Nothing was done to it and it was sitting on a shelf
It fits in her purse and she loves the quality
It is easy to use
I've gotten some great bird shots and compliments on a close up of the moon
My friend bought a cheaper one and the photo prints are significantly better and without streaks
The picture was breathtaking
It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack
Articulating screens are not necessary for me and I'm not overly impressed with touch screens
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
My only wish is that the t5 had come with the sensor cleaning function Canon's earlier models came with
It's easy to use in auto mode or has plenty of settings for the novis/hobbist that doesn't want to invest a couple of grand in lense's and bodies
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
A snap on/off cover would be a better option for lens cap
The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job
Very light and slim which makes it easy to carry
The camera itself is ok, again, just ok
In real estate we make pictures in vacant houses with no power and this is a great asset
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
I have never shot so many blurry pictures in a 1 week span before
Normally I don't give items a one-star review, but this one has earned it
Very handy if you like how a picture turned out and want to try to repeat the results
5 star rating for this product, IMHO
I am very pleased with the COOLPIX L830
You can also select which picture you would like to print which is great
Another lens failure
Just recently purchased this camera and was excited about using it but had problems with this at my daughters wedding
Flash is not this camera's strong suit in any case
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
New 16MP high-resolution, high-speed CMOS Sensor
I recommend this camera to anyone
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera
My daughter took it on a trip and even tho she left it mostly on auto - the pictures and video were stunning
I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
Also, after 2 months the lens cover stopped opening when we turned on the power rendering the camera unusable
Great pictures, not fuzzy, no distortion, even when I've zoomed it to the max
I often find that my fingers confuse the issue without my intention or permission
It was terrible
Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
The instructions are easy
In every mode except Manual the settings are easy to find and use
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
I have determined that if you use this camera in flash mode, you have to remember to open the flash before you shoot by depressing the shutter halfway, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO ANYWAY TO SET THE FOCUS
I took the camera on vacation and didn't get a bad picture
I am very pleased with the upgrades from my SX300HS
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
Even I can take decent pictures with this camera
I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
Real Disappointment
And using the low light setting, such as what you would use with a birthday cake with candles type of picture, works amazingly well
Very poor picture quality
Very easy to use, features are intuitive, menus are simple but give you a lot of options if you want to get creative
All I have to do is point the camera at the picture I want and click
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
Could also be improved in low light autofocus locking on at higher zoom levels in incandescent lighting
Balanced
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
If you're recording something silent, you can hear the zoom a little, but isn't that true with all video cameras?  This camera also has a great feature for slow motion videos
The pictures are crisp
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
I know nothing about any of the other settings
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX
you have to push a button to switch between the two
i definately recommend a large memory card .
Its the worst camera ever pictures quality are the worst and everything about this camera is a joke
I've tried put jpg images taken by an iphone into the SD card, but it can not read the pictures and shows "file error"
I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes
Ineke Baker-Adan
It's by no means an SLR with different adjustable lens attachments, so if you're looking for that kind of technicality, this isn't the one you want, but for the price, it's an all-around great camera
Iâve even linked it to my iPhone5 over Wi-Fi and like the ability to transfer pictures so that I can post some immediately on Flickr or Facebook
I had purchased rechargeables, and they lasted the rest of the two weeks in France, with power to spare
Other wise this is an amazing camera
I love this camera
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
It takes really clear pictures with nice color balance and tones
We just had a baby and wanted a good camera to capture memories, and we made the right choice
which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect
present
It took unbelievable pictures and the size
Wife loves it
I was able to get them back by downloading a program on my computer and reading the card separately from my camera, but my god that sucked
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body
I find the ability to swivel the screen on my Canon camera extremely useful (high shots, low shots, etc
I tried to be positive, but
However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal
the red is gorgeous, which is a plus, a deep shimmery black cherry sort of color
LOW LIGHTIt is not magical
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
I have tried the same settings that I use on my other cameras and was not pleased with the results at all
Nothing but Awesome
Amazing camera
The camera is great for what it is
I had an older FZ model years ago that I loved and am excited about this one
I recommend it to everyone
I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
I've owned a few Nikons in the past, and am happy with this easy to use model at a pretty good price
From the prospective of the image resolution, it is nice to step up from the prior 12 MP to the new 16 MP especially for landscape photos, what allows to present more fine details and to make your pictures to look more natural than before
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
(5) Continuous shooting mode, while very fast, only supports 5 photos at once
still waiting for coupon for 99% off second one
I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
Even with the lens touching an object, I was able to get sharp focus
I am just a disabled dude who is fascinated with the art of taking pictures that appeal to me
Since it is just past the one year warranty, it too is junk
I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
Out of 337 332 were good
Much better to have separate controls for these 3 MAJOR variants, or at a minimum, a separate button to switch between purposes
Don't expect it to be more than that
I used it (for 1st time) at my son's college graduation with excellent results
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
Top Notch Camera
love this camera
(3) Flash performance is relatively poor, especially in contrast to everything else about this camera
I went out and bought a SanDisk card and the camera finally accepted it without error
My Nikon S8100 failed on the second day of use after about 20 shots with a fatal lens error
i love it and i would recommend it to many people
I hope this long winded review was of some help
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
Great little camera
Performance-wise, the camera's colors consistently look good and the camera consistently produces pictures that look natural
The quality of both still images and video is excellent
I now have two of these A3000's
I bought the camera because of its zoom
so I passed on it
In this age of modern electronics, the camera itself is a plastic coated, clunky, over sizepiece of junk with what appears to be a plastic lens
I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera
I have a hand tremor so normally have a great deal of difficulty getting decent pictures
But so far I am unable to get really clear shots at the full zoom length
It has 10x optical zoom plus around 4x digital
Sony A3000 Super Value
I was also perplexed at the menu manipulation and understanding what the camera was telling me it could do
Thank you to Amazon for undoing my mistake
This Nikon has completely changed my mind about the brand and I will be a Nikon loyalist from now on :)
I'm still learning settings
I was very happy with this purchase
:(I just recently sent it in, after I dropped it and the lens wouldn't retract
Still, everything seems to fit together tightly and the housing is sturdy
broke after 2 months
It comes loaded with goodies
I haven't dropped or mistreated the cameras, as far as I know
Great camera
Beautiful picture
Again, this is perfect for travel or family use
I mostly use it for going out with friends and in casual settings (the occasional nature shot)
I Love My Nikon
I added a couple of photos of my cat and golden retriever taken in the continuous mode (12MP*)
After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji
I was extremely excited and looking forward to this feature only to find out it was completely useless
Therefor, I am returning it for a refund
It records great videos with stereo sound
When you've reached the end of your pan, just release the shutter button
The LCD screen is low res
If you follow the tips and step-by-step above even if you just use the lens included you will get better at photography
The first was the L810, I didn't like that one because my images were getting scrambled when i used the review function so I was pissed but decided to give Nikon a second chance and bought the S8100
The video itself is quite amazing
Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
Not at all worth $200
I haven't actually used it yet, but it's a Nikon, need I say more? Love the red color and the size
good product
Third camera for a family member
And re the view finder, or the flat screen on the back, if you find these a problem, you never worked in the old days where all we had was a ground glass viewer
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has more features than I need
Great camera for the money
It is the first camera I have used that allows me to get non-blurry pictures of my grandchildren who are constantly moving
I can live with that
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
Excellant Camera
Use the USB cable to charge the battery in the camera,  4hrs, OR, get an extra charger and battery and do it that way, you HAVE A CHOICE with the s8100
Caveats / Downsides: (These are all relatively minor complaints, not deal-breakers, although they're all things that are annoyances that I notice on a regular basis
In sum, better buy another brand
Other than that, for $160, you get a fully functioning 10 mp camera
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
After a long research I think I did the BEST choice
It is a fun gadget but quality of the camera and prints could be better
The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
Wrong, except that my problems are different.
We were not disappointed at all
I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
Fairly simple to operate & it's not bulky
There was NOTHING at all the least bit loose on my new Nikon Coolpix L830
the video quality of the camera is excellent, but all of my photos using the flash are overexposed
She had to end the last days of her vacation taking pictures with lenses shadowing in the pictures
So far after a few months of owning this unit, I have no issues and am having fun with it
For my money, I think I can do better, so I returned this one
I have had Panasonic Lumix models and a Casio
The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it
The Sony A3000 is the answer to your dreams if you don't want have the time to learn to shoot a DSLR but want something better than a point and shoot camera
this is a great camera for you !
I really cannot explain my level of awe from this camera
Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting
It is very easy to use as well
It is obviously not a compact camera to accommodate the powerful zoom lens
Received 5/4/11 & returned 5/5/11
But I had to upload the directions for all the features
camera
CAREFUL
i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
This camera is everything I wanted
I added a memory card and can switch from internal to external memory depending on my memory needs
I can't find the info from Polaroid's website but I don't think this LCD has a good quality
The camera is stylish and comfortable to use
It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever
Could use stronger zoom
Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs
I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
sony great model camera, delivered ok, little pack, good pricepros: allcons: noi recomend this camera to any
learning how to use it will not take very long .
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
+Good weight and balance, feels sturdy, unlike the Sony fixed-lens cameras I've tested recently+Quiet operation+Good Battery Life+Proper manual and priority modes-Underwhelming viewfinder and LCD panel on the back-Slow and sometimes flakey autofocus when not in broad daylight-Forcing JPG to save with RAW
You can also upload to Mac or windows and print off larger images
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
Exactly what we were looking for in a reasonably priced high quality compact camera
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
Up close, midway, or far out, it handles it all and with amazing clarity
A horse and buggy it's not
An extra memory card allows to take more pictures
this compact Nikon arrived today and it took all of 3 minutes to prepare it and turn it on, which is as quick as claimed
Full 1080p out of such an inexpensive and already feature packed camera with the quality it offers is amazing
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
the only point and shoot that satisfy your photography
 I went out and got the Canon today.
After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
A+ and I am telling everyone who wants a nice compact camera to shoot almost anything for a reasonable price
I wasn't okay with it
Many have mentioned build and photo quality
I like the feature that corrects for camera shake, as I had sometimes had blurry photos with my older camera and this is much improved with the Sony
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
Crossing my fingers the lens doesnt start acting up, i will update my review if anything goes wrong
Garbage
i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
Beyond those few features, I found the camera to be relatively lackluster and uninspiring
It was recommended by a friend for the type of photographer that I am and it is exactly as described
We have 2 yr old Grandson who enjoys having his picture made as much an any 2 yr old
for that price this camera its awesomethe quality  of  the picture is pretty good you take a very cool picture in the night with out flashyou can install external flash and lens on the camera its lightcharging its little tricky but you can buy external battery charger to charge the batter quickly
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
really like this camera
&#34;2, The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is very light
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
My bff got this as a christmas gift and rated it very high
The only thing I couldn't do was switch to black & white photos, which would have been cool in the fog
Oh, get it from Amazon too bc it's way cheaper
There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
Very nice but with common problem of LED/LCD screens
I sat in my kitchen and took a picture of one ornament on the tree in the family room, and I could see the clarity as if I were right in front of it
Only thing I'm not crazy about is having to replace batteries
It's been a great purchase
Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
We also took some shots outside after dark and this camera really excels at night
What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality
I intend to carry it in my backpack and play with it some
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
It's not suitable for action photography, but for all other kinds of photographic situations, it's certainly up to the task
Great buy
Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me
Of course, at $200, this is a pretty expensive toy - mine has been on a shelf for months and it doesn't look like a need is going to come up for me to want to use it again
Still small enough to fit into your pocket
It has no major flaws and can be counted to operate reliably every time
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
Will be posting it with a return notification
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
This offers two fully automatic modes ("intelligent Auto" and "Superior Auto", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode
It totally delivers
I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
I loved the 12x zoom and image stabilization for taking the corners of buildings like the Forbidden Palace
It has many advanced features for a compact, such as the ability to view a histogram and to look at the information of pictures you've already taken, like the ISO sensitivity used
The image quality is great
I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
The LCD screen resolution doubled
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
:)I recently recorded my sons bastkeball game and the video was great
It grabs a quick picture when we need it
It is an excellent device
Great pics
The seller had it to me very quickly and I am extremely satisfied with their packaging and quality of product
Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do
) when shooting special projects, but often don't want to take all that gear along when I travel
What is the difference between this expensive Nikon and $5 Kodak digitial
Zoom
It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
it appears it would survive a truck driving over it
The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
Some of the picky reviews I read tells me these guys are clueless operators or have a malfunctioning unit (It happens to the best)I admit it took me some head-scratching to understand both of the photo programs that arrived in the camera box for loading into the computer
- File name conflicts
And now the SX700 with a 30 zoom
it's the lens
I've had Nikons before
Nearly perfect
I would definitely recommend skipping this Panasonic for something else
The only down side I think it feals a little fragile
The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
It took a little playing to get it to connect with my iPad the first time, but wow, what a nice feature
Well it only had four shots on
I gave the camera as a gift and though it's fairly large in size, considering it has a printer included I'd say the the size is perfect
The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography
I thought this camera was very well priced also
it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
I love the fact you can tilt the screen
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
In fact, it is the biggest reason behind the selection
A nice camera to use easy to handle takes great pictures used it at a family gathering a few weeks after getting it
(Darn
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
It can take pictures even in the darkest place
Highly recommend this camera
It's perfect for this use
It comes with its own rechargeable battery
Excellent camera
I just got back from a trip to DC where I used my iPhone as a backup sometimes, and I got much better quality from the iPhone
And for the video, if you leave it set to continuous AF, when you play it back you can hear the focus mechanism clicking over and over again to regain focus
I read that it is recommended to drop exposure by 1/3
And being able to have instant photos
All you get is a fleeting warning before the battery dies
Looks like I am standing right next to him
WOW
Still photos at high resolution you can even see stitching in knit sweater
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
For me it was not worthwhile due to two simple factors
This is a great compact point and shoot camera
Great so far, awesome zoom, good quality and sharpness; still playing with some of the features
Nikon s8100
I use it mostly on Auto and it works extremely well
Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension
When I saw the ad I was thrilled as I had checked it out before going to Amazon
That pricepoint is just laughable
It's a great camera although like many new technologies it does far too many things for my purposes
Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
Extremely clear and realistic
The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
In good light, this camera takes very nice pictures
definetely a great camera .
great tool
Fortunately, I have had the good luck to travel with photographers, leaving me free to spend time looking
There is a problem with the USB/AV port on the camera
21 Days, one suitcase, I go light
I've tried tweaking the settings a little bit and choosing various scenes but the pictures just look bad
Great purchase
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
Looking forward to micro photos and other features
The charger of the battery didn't work, so I need bought a new charger
It is too simple for such a camera
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
The blood moon effect was awesome
Here are some useful facts:-
Amazing Camera but No Manual Mode
It's just not worth it
Then turn it on and press the 'menu' button
I spent a lot of time reviewing compact cameras prior to settling on this one
Quick time between photos, surprisingly quick flash cycling even
The photos taken in low light are fantastic; much better than I would have imaged
In bright indoor lighting, it may be  better to use aperture priority mode, choose the largest aperture available (3
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
from the time you press the shutter activate button to the time it focuses and the shutter goes, it's nearly 2 seconds which is eons
My husband thought I was getting way to much confidence in the zoom, but my pictures turned out great especially for a point and shoot
I have noticed fewer problems after shooting with the camera for several days, but remain leery
I bought an external charger with two batteries off EBAY for $10
I like the fact that it's a 30x zoom-yet is pocket-sized
I suspect I was swayed by the positive reviews I read
I didn't want all the different lenses to mess with
I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it
After reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other places on the web, as well as watching too many You Tube videos, I came to the conclusion that the FZ70 would be a good, affordable  replacement for my aging 35mm Cannon SLR
Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3
It really beats my 16
It is really nice and pretty compact for the amount of zoom it offers
Its does really well in low light also
It was a great addition
I don't do any video, so can't comment on that
heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception
On the cruise I was less worried about packing light and cords and such so I brought both cameras and chose depending on the situation (Nikon at night, Canon on most excursions)
The zoom is phenomenal
They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality
The 60x zoom is fantastic for wildlife, and the image stabilization system works very well
I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs
It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
battery life is ok .
so you can hear the stereo sound better
I bought this as a carry around
So nice and compact
I am sure I would have been content with the Canon but I love this Nikon
I wanted a DSLR, but didn't have the money for one
Not having a view finder sucks, but I shoot with a nice Nikon and that's all I use
Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
I decided to spend the money for a good one and this seems to be it
Great Pics
It is also really quick (start up and shutter speed)
I really honestly don't see how anybody with larger hands could find the SL1 comfortable to shoot with given its very shallow grip
I have had no problems with that at all
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 right out of the box an amazing point and shoot camera and becomes an even more awesome camera when you really start digging into it
I appreciate it even more after I download the photos to my computer and as I review them, I notice more details that the human naked eyes couldn't even see when taking the photos
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
Purchased this camera to take pictures and video of my son graduating boot camp
I love this Nikon Coolpix L830 because; the more I learn about it the more it becomes an extention of my imagineation
Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
Love it
You will know it is there, but it is not bothersome
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
Cons: No high-speed-shutter scene mode, which makes this unacceptable for my travel camera
I primary do landscape/birds
What a waste of time & money -- are the pictures worth it?  I probably could have gotten shots just as nice from a Canon or Kodak (and will in the future)
the sx280)
Nice camera for the money
Error message of "this card cannot be read"
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
So far a GOOD solid VERY SMALL (for 10x) Zoom Auto Point and Shoot - But doesn't over come the laws of physics
Neither of these Transcend cards or any of the other 4 SD cards I already had would work in the camera
The camera takes clean photos through ISO800, and still performs fairly decently through ISO3200
Great camera that takes great pictures
This is my first Sony I also have a Nikon D5000 but at times you do not need a big camera so the Sony is great
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
There's an option for 1600 and 3200, and while I use them infrequently as they're nosier, I'm glad they're an option
It's not entirely on par with a proper DSLR, but they're getting there
com, these are the A3000's key features:20
For $200 (or less) more The NX 2000 with 2 lenses is a better deal
The last digital camera I purchased was 10 years ago
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
My fujifilm S8200 had terrible zoom noise
Amazing quality
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
In its small size it packs a sufficiently powerful zoom, excellent resolution and high reslution video
Anyway, I liked this camera, is a beautiful color (I have in red) and I am not professional but I can take good pictures with it
Pictures excellent
We were looking for a really good pics with a great auto mode and we narrowed our choices to the Nikon 8100, Sony HX5V, ZS5 and Canon SX210is
In Arizona, I took lots of photos at an outdoor Chihuly exhibit in the Arizona Botanical Garden, both in the afternoon and early evening light
You would think the batteries weigh the camera down but nope, this camera is small and light
I use alkaline and rechargeables and may use lithium in the future
anyway, I could not get passed it
If I'm shooting RAW, I want RAW only, adding JPGs just reduces available cache and storage and increases write time
Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
I had a larger more professional 7mp camera in the past and found myself leaving it behind when I went places with my wife and kids
may be later I can have a better oppinion on it
Sample photos will soon be available on our web site: [
If you are about images, this camera is a delightful tool to use
I noted that the s830 was better rated on Amazon
If you touch the lens when it zooms in or out, it reports &#34;lens error
I've only found online stores that sell it
Yes, it's huge
Amazing camera
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
Images up to ISO1600 were pretty good for a 1/2
See if your local library has them, or download an ecopy
The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash
The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement
I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn
Excellent Pictures
While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well
Which reminds me, I think some of the negative comments about the FZ70, in terms of sharpness, may just have been due to an erroneous setting on the mode dial
It has a great zoom as long as there is not fast movement
At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there
I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
I am so impressed with this camera
Yes, it is still relatively small compared to other cameras, but I guess I'm just used to my old Nikon camera that could be easily accessible at moments notice
Lots of bells and whistles, but lacking in photo quality
The camera seems pretty well built, this is our first nikon, we have always had milnota or kodak in the past
no biggies
I haven't done many people shots with flash yet , so I cannot comment of reports of the flash washing out subjects
That makes taking pictures much more efficient
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
what's not to like?First, here's what I've learned since acquiring this camera: even though it can accommodate interchangeable lenses and has an apparently conventional viewfinder, it is NOT a DSLR
Poor camera choice, stick to cannon, kodak, or sony
Get out and about and enjoy
a great decision and purchase all the way around
Indeed it was, I brought FZ70 with expedited shipping, as I was heading out to SF to see my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren and I wanted to be able to test it out during the trip
Since I loved the quality of photos of the S8000, I thought the S8100 might have better quality besides some upgrades tot eh focal plane, better dark performance, etc
Cons if you call them that:-I am still worried that the lens is going to stick out, but i clean it daily and it hasnt stuck yet
It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
I've had a heck of a time with this camera
The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon
Understand the majority of reviews are done by well meaning rookie photographers
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
Best camera I have ever owned
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
Bulkier and heavier than expected but it takes very good pictures and people comment on the clarity of it's long reach
I own a Canon SLR, two Fuji bridge cameras, two Olympus point and shoot and one other Panasonic pocket point and shoot
Nikon will not cover under warranty, wants $100 to repair a $200 camera, that's approx 4 months old
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
The paper is a bit expensive but what I love about this Polaroid instant camera over other instant cameras (by Fujifilm etc
Very Amateur Photographer
The pictures are coming out very nice
The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3
great portable camera w/ awesome video
So take my review for what its worth
I have been taking the best pictures EVER since I got this camera
Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken
Sharpness is not an issue and color is very accurate, better than average for sure
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
None of these is a show-stopper for me, and there is indeed a lot to like, but I can't call this the best camera ever made
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
The zoom has an autofocus which truly does work
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
This is the best camera in its class, that is, the best compact zoom
For the price, you can't beat it
I also would rather have a "slide on/off" button like on the FZ50 than the type that is on the FZ70
I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it
I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
It feels just wonderful in my hands as the grip is perfect even though my hands are small
I guess if wifi doesn't matter to you then this is your camera
The zoom on this camera is impressive
not so much here
very good
The form factor is nice, great for keeping the camera steady on the go
The same problem appeared with the replacement after a few months
But it did not last very long before I got the dreaded "lens malfunction"
Great Camera
Did I also say that the auto focus on this camera is FAST and accurate?  Well, it's "VERY fast, and accurate"
In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
The first thing you notice is the grip
Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough
Great value, rare 20mm wide angle plus super 60x zoom
The video itself is fantastic and crisp with smooth playback
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
The LCD screen is one of the best I have ever seen and is of high quality
A great upgrade for me, all my family pictures, inside/outside are much better
Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot
I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4
Have been disappointed with this camera
Found it on Amazon for $199 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping
SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera
Wonderful little camera
This camera is terrible under low lighting and is just overall a piece of crap
This is a camera for the niche market
Wow, what a zoom
I read this camera's review and I though it was a no-brainer
Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC
When the camera detects a flash is needed, it automatically pops up
i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
Two of us had these little wonders
Basicaly made in China junk
This camera is harder to hold still for a quick shot than my little sony
Wonderful first camera or as a step up without spending big bucks
Great camera, good price
The basic 18-55 lens is great for your daily pictures plus you have the option of getting different purpose lens as well
We stayed with Nikon because of past cameras
Be aware that you have to pay the return postage and a hefty restocking fee
I was able to drag the manual off the CD ROM into a new file on my desktop, so I don't have to use the CD to read it
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
I have and will continue to recommend this fine camera to all interested folks
this should give you an idea of the capabilities of the camera
Software Defect
Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that
With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
VERY FAST FOCUSING AAND FAST ZOOM
It looks like one, but has no mirror
I expected not much but the digital files are of acceptable quality
whoa .
This camera is great for all ages
takes good pictures
After owning Canons and Nikons I tried this one because of the 30 X ZOOM and am VERY PLEASED
Two annoying things though (and I'm sure it was to cut down on cost
now I can continue to record because it NEVER shows up
The metal housing seems very rugged.
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
it works)
The COOLPIX L830 is a very sophisticated camera for the price
I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way
the camera was a marvel .
Solid camera
Also it uses the same memory cards and battery that the DMC-FZ40 did
It has worked very well
I would not recommend this camera
It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect
The zoom capability is amazing
I'm a mom who loves taking pictures of her kids, pets and flowers
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
Cameras worked fine but you had to hold the battery door shut
1 MP Olympus hands down
You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge
What I didn't like about it is that it feels cheap and made of plastic material but Nikon may have done it to make it light in the weight
I like that it automatically goes to or from facial reconition to macro, etc
The new sensor is unbelievable
the light auto-correction is awesome .
Quick delivery and good product
I'm still trying to figure out the other features because there is so many
Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size
We used this on our trip to San Antonio and Corpus Christi and were not disappointed in the quality of the pictures taken by it
I haven't tried editing videos as yet, so I cannot comment on that, but so far so good
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price
It comes with everything you need to start except a case and SD card
I do appreciate the night pictures and the 12mp
Great pictures and I like the 34x zoom lens
I have no regrets with this purchase
excellent idea !
once the light went off in the brain it became a very simple task; however; I did think that all was lost the first time around
My more mechanical wife managed to get it closed and I left with the camera
For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background
All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
Since you need to be mindful of the flash placement, holding this camera is awkward further exasperating the issue
The camera starts up fast and is quick from shot to shot
Soo basically you are getting an apsc camera body for 200$
It was well worth the purchase
The 20X zoom on the SX280 was good, the 30X on the SX700 is even better and gives me better photos of distant objects
I wanted something that I could leave a photo with the folks I took pictures of
30X stabilization and pic quality are not perfect but pretty good
Very very nice pics, the "auto modes" work great
I can now say with first hand information, that Nikon is now making JUNK
I will make sure and purchase a screen protector for the LCD
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
Use it in anything but good light and things go downhill with the overly aggressive noise reduction
For someone who doesn't need professional pictures, this is a wonderful camera
The failure of this S8100 was also at a very bad time as it is at the beginning of time with grandsons from the Mid West
The mechanism does seem very sensitive to dust
In good light and low light the things a champ.
The problem is that when you take a photo, and you want to get the best results, and the image is not good, sometimes you can not duplicate that moment
Hi,I am unable to write a review of this camera because I have only received defective cameras
i cancelled the order .
Fairly Ordinary Camera
this is going to be a long process
I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial
and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos
Excellent camera
2 at the widest end)  and shooting without any flash
cameras capture moments .
You can view your pictures without the lens being extended
Fortunately the product works and our niece was okay with it having been opened, however we are sorely disappointed that Amazon lacks quality control even with third party dealers
No ink, digital images better than expected, decent low lighting shots
My son is using it to launch his youtube career -- he really needs to focus on college
So far, so good
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
In stock items shipped free always arrive in less than 5 days but since this one did not ship I may not see it until next week
Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400
I have few digital cameras, but this one is the best ever
The zoom is great, very simple option menu, great portability, come with a manual
I will say in their favor that the pics are extremely good but the two items above make my experience go sour
The camera exceeded my expectations
I'm a Cannon man back in the day but Nikon has won me over
a 2014 release with NO Orientation Sensor
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as "used" which are in fact open box
First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
poor quality
IT IS however for the photographer looking for an innovative and unique product with multiple capabilities
The plastic cover for these outlets is very flimsy and feels like it's going to break off everytime they are moved to plug a cable in
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
when doing work where the object isn't so "flighty" (
All had the same results.
This is not comparable at all, in any way, to DSLR
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
Simple to use the camera's many functions
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
I wanted a camera that took awesome pictures and this new Nikon Coolpix L830 does that with ease
I think this is a good thing for people who is learning photography
Over all, you cant complain about this little thing
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
I've read where some were having problems with blurry pictures
The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
The macro is fantastic in camera and movie mode and I would say that plus the zoom are the camera's best features
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
I was able to get sharp hand held images at 60X zoom most of the time
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
I spent a month looking at cameras, Nikon, Canon, Samsung and more, but after reading all the reviews and being completely confused, selected the L830 and am happy I did
I look forward to taking pictures from my window of deer and critters that wander into the far reaches of the yard
(Digital single lens reflex--a camera you can change lenses to add a telephoto or a wide angle lens like the pros do
It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
I believe mine may have been one of the rare defective items that occasionally escape quality control
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
great idea but thats it
It tends to run out faster when I am just in a printing  session and unfortunately taking out the camera battery deletes the date/time setting, which you have to set before being able to take pictures
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
I took the camera on vacation and loved having it
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
I an very happywith my choice of camera
I recommend this product 100%
This is a great camera
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
6 SHOTS w DIFFERENT EFFECTS w 1 push of the shutter release
i am not talking milliseconds .
A great camera
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
Images are a tad soft, but Auto+ does a great job producing solid images
Not bad for instant crafting
I truly recommend this camera, but keep in mind you are not buying a $2000 camera
Nice
and i'm glad i did!
As expected, cheaper than the competition and as good as the competition
No complaints whatsoever
(i can't help but play with the camera always)
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
It has great value
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
So we bought the s830
Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera
then it just wouldnt print at all, even when i wanted it too
Most expensive point & shoot I have owned
Still learning
May also need a little bit more post production work during the stitching process
We got the S8100, and she now gets amazing videos, with which we both are pleased
Its a cute little camara and I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants that old polaroid feel
PROS:- easy to use, right out the box- battery life better  than expected- great value @ $279
The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
However the users manual is practically worthless
feels solid in hand .
I get a lot of complements on this camera and questions of "where can I get one?" and it got only a tiny chip when it fell four feet onto concrete
I'm just disappointed that it was hyped so much and it doesn't hold up to its name
If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
I recommend this camera to others people
I bought this camera to donate for a raffle to raise money for life
Overall, a wonderful camera with excellent quality photos, great zoom, good size, CMOS chip allows for awesome night shots (for better visibility only
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
Pictures were prone to blurring, I would say this has the least effective optical image stabilization of any point-and-shoot I've owned
I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature and has a moderate budget
I was able to get close-ups and distance shots with one camera
looks more sturdy and easy to hold on hand than SX519
It can take brilliant photo and video, well beyond my expectations
As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
Nikon Camera
New Camera
I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
The zoom is spectacular
I suggest getting in a store and test it out
Loving it so far
it was a great deal
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
Great camera takes good pictures
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
I bought it new, but i got the item with lots of scratches on the screen
Absolutely LOVE this camera
My son printed out a little 2 by 3 picture that he took of he and his brother in law and it is perfect for my wallet
If you're looking for a good case, the Case Logic QBP-202 is a perfect fit (still allows you to store a small cable and some SD cards if needed)
4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
We took it on vacation with us and on the 3rd day I got a "lens error"
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
Researched cameras before deciding to buy this one, and expected a lot
It is actually very light and came with a nice leather case
The software that comes with it is impressive
fiance did n't like the feel .
The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
And has more than enough settings to capture the image in many differnt lights and you can edit on the camera
Took it out for a test shoot today
This Panasonic camera takes excellent pictures
I bought this camera from my daughter for her birthday and she likes the one we have which is a slightly older model
This is a gadget in all the sense of the word, not something professional photographers or nitpickers should get, because you will be disappointed
the best in semiprofesional cameras
Great compact camera that probably rivals entry level DSLR models
It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
Others:1200mm is possible with hand-held, but you need good light and at least 1/200 shutter speed
The video's turned out good also
Professional quality pictures by an inexperienced photographer
Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
The price was the best I've seen anywhere
Nice Camera
Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand
I have found that the video is really great compared to an older video camera I had
The outdoor ones were better than the indoor ones
We go riding in the desert in a side by side and this is perfect for that - small and stowable, but takes wonderful distance shots of the beautiful desert vistas
Recently swapped my much heavier Nikon D90 for the much lighter Sony A3000, since owning this new camera my interest in photography has gone through the roof
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
Pictures are crystal clear; camera is small and compact
The app then connects to the phone and applies the tag based on date/time
A good thing is you only print pictures you like
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
Also, with the zoom extended to the max, sometimes it takes a little time for lens to focus sharply on the object, playing with the settings for the focus area helps
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
All in all I am very satisfied
This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
Okay camera, mediocre image quality, poor controls
I always purchase a Panasonic Lumix camera because I really like the ones I have purchased in the past but the FZ70 has a few changes from my FZ50 that I can't say I care for
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
great camera for the price
But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
Get it and you won't be sorry
The camera even recognizes how many people are in the frame by placing a square over each face to focus
I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
It's easy to use and gives you little tips about different tools
My daughter Loves taking pictures with this camera
You won't regret buying this C=
After thousands of photos, it is ready for retirement
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
lens changable
The plastic feel is a nice strong plastic so it keeps the feeling of it being novelty while feeling of good quality
The EVF-LCD switch is manual because there is no eye sensor
For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body
They are absolutely amazing
BEST Digital handy
30x Optical Zoom Works Great, the best compact camera with zoom
All round I am extremely pleased with camera: handles well and feels solid and chunky but not too heavy
Love this camera
From reading the other reviews, I'm thinking either I'm doing something wrong or mine is defective
I think this was the best idea to come up with this camera along with the lens together as a bundle deal
We wanted the longer zoom, but were disappointed in the results
i just thought it's cute and cool =)
I love how you can pick which pictures you want, add boarders, edit colors
Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds
This camera has all of the features that I was looking for
We have had very good luck taking indoor pics in an auditorium
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
Easy interface and quick response
After a couple of weeks so far so good
The 1080p HD video is records is unbelievable, then plug the camera right into the TV via HDMI and watch video or view pictures
For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner
the 60x lens with image stabilization is amazing
This was in bright sunlight so with less light I wouldn't expect such good results
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
works great
Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
Unfortunately, the unit I received didn't focus consistently at all at the longer focal length
Yo-This replaces my 'old' Lumix DMC-FZ60 and gives me a greatly improved wider and way longer lens distance with somewhat better picture quality
the screen cracked and couldnt turn it on
The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
He loved it
This camera makes it simple
All in all, no complaints
I thought little of it, and tried to reinstall the drivers through the device's preferences, but found that the option was unavailable for some reason
excellent range of metering options as well .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
It wouldn't be fair of me to leave a "full" product review yet since I'm still learning about some of the features on the camera
I was not able to get the pictures uploaded to my computer the process was very difficult
Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
The lens protrudes a little, so this 'compact camera' is a bit bulkier (the lens also adds a bit of weight) than its peers, but for 10x zoom and the quality of pictures its a fair trade off
Great Camera for the price
Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
For the money this camera cant be beat
my daughter loves it, great for that quick spontaneous picture
But because there is no viewfinder, it is difficult to take pictures, as it is very hard to keep it still, especially with the zoom
The only complain I have is that the camera is not suitable for fast moving objects like sports
It is sophisticated looking and easy to work
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes
Awesome lay out of buttons: record for video is a hard button that can be used in any mode
EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway
Edit- I was told wrong by the Nikon rep
This camera fits perfectly between my Rebel XT DSLR, which takes excellent pictures but is bulky (especially with all the lenses) and a small and light ELPH 100HS point and shoot
I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
This kinda feels like a toy, but what cool, fun gadget isn't
In my opinion, if you have less than $600 to spend and you want only one bridge camera, then I believe this FZ70 is made for you
Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
Best Compact Point and Shoot
The photos are to soft and Just out of focus on the ones I tried
Unbeatable for dollar spent
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
The included software removes any red eye easily.
The L830 has to be manually released to function, but knowing that
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
HD video is captured in the
I'm still testing it out, but so far its definitely a keeper
So depressed but then
Been taking pictures for over 30 years and needed to upgrade
Does not meet the hype, Aviod it completely
I wouldnot suggest the Nikon Coolpix L830 for guys with massive or even large hands since everything is tightly packed onto the camera
I keep having to put in new batteries every time I turn around to use it
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
I was able to take lots of great pics & print the picture out & give them out to the guests at the party as presents :) When you buy this camera buy a SD card too so you can have lots of pics saved to camera
The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers
So yeah it feels kinda cheap and the screen on the back could be much nicer but it is perfect for capturing the family around the new baby
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
The only drawback is the EVF really lacks clarity
I no longer take pictures professionally, so I looked into a light weight camera that at least had most of the bells and whistles
I asked to one guy take a picture of us and he couldn`t believe how good was the camera and he asked me where I bought it
came close on this one
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
No suggestions for improvement
I do not like the LCD screen either
I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake
it is not perfect though .
I have had this little gem for four months now.
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
Takes great photos
Really great camera
Summary: Video and still shooters--T5i is best, T5 is good
But the pictures are beautiful
Exactly what I wanted
my old camera can take 40 photos in seconds this one seems to have a lag when continuous shooting
i've tried the polaroid 300 and didn't care for it either
Im very happy with this purchase
1 MP where?
The FZ200 has a Leica lens
I would recommend this product to the  non-professional who simply wants great pictures and video
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
When I received my camera I was so excited
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
Picture quality is unbelievable
Also, so far I have found it to be quite fast with little shutter lag and good in low light situations
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
Bought it, returned it
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
We went camping this weekend and I took a picture of the moon
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is amazingly versatile and can pretty much take care of all of your photography needs
Once unplugged the camera would shut off and not turn on
I returned mine about 2 days after i got it  it was not worth the money
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
other times the picture quality is great but that is very minor
comparison between L830 and predecesor L820
I did some sample shots inside the house in a dimly light room
Results from scene modes may not give the desired results
Awesome Camera though
First of all, throw out the batteries that come with the camera
Low quality camera
Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
Can't rate higher than 4 stars because I haven't used this camera
The zoom also bothered me due to A LOT of shakiness, which I understand happens at the highest zoom and being hand held, but again, I didn't experience that much of it with my previous camera
Easy to use Small to carry on
In efforts to make the camera as small as possible, Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
Bulky, ok camera
Can't get it shipped
Review of the Canon SX700 with comparison to the older sx280
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
I love my new camera
I've taken this camera on two trips- one to Arizona, and one to France
I am amazed with its zoom capability
The Sony a3000 takes clear, noise free photos even in low light and crisp, bright video
He completely loves it, I can said is a good camera, nice with panoramic pictures (totally worth it)
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
I always shoot with the the red label (iA)
This camera is the best I've ever owned
If you are shopping for a DSLR camera, be aware -- this is not the one
We ordered this after seeing it featured on a local tv station's &#34;Tech Check
This is a very good camera in all respects, and great value for the money
I plan on exchanging it
Thats a plus in my book
I did a lot of research and bought the Case-Logic case, which is perfect for the camera, and an extra battery or soft bristled brush to dust off the lens housing before stowing it away
My wife and I take a lot of wild life photos
Nothing looked dark very clear
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
It also came with charges for any country you may be using it in
You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
Still, I'm happy with my purchase and hope to get good use out of the camera
Its novelty is great and if all else fails, you got a nice camera for family outings and the likes
In my case, flash comes up whenever there is not enough light unless I turn it off
So far, so good
The short videos were excellent quality and meant I didn't need to lug my video camera along
However, if you're looking for the best camera to take to a concert for example, this is it
I wish the quality was better
so buy the g3 .
however, it is an older version
IQ clarity is a strength for this camera
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
I haven't figured out how to take good action photos though
I bought this camera for my gf since she always wanted one that has the ability to print pictures - but after using it on several occasions I wish I got one that you have to wait for the picture to show up on the paper
Such a nice camera for a cheap price
Although small, it is still better than noneIt has a mode dial like a real dSLR
Nice
I bought this camera last March
Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel
It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
No stitching photos together, just click and hold the shutter button and turn
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
I need to experiment with it more, but so far very pleased
Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
There are many modes available, some actually useful, and some interesting in-camera editing capabilities for those who wish to do that
There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes
Never buy a point and click Nikon again
FREAKING AWESOME ZOOM
Beyond the flickering, I felt the camera simply took poor photos compared to other cameras I have had, even those with 1/4 to 1/2 the resolution of this one
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
Have not had a chance to try out the video in detail but the few shots I've taken look incredibly good
HD video: One of my favorite things about this line of cameras is you can shoot video at 1080p which is very high-resolution and looks great on high definition televisions and even on YouTube
I now have to go and spend more of my money on a SD card reader so I can easily transfer photos
As with photos, the low-light performance is impressive too
Like others, I have found it very difficult to get a decent quality image from this camera
For sub $300, I think it's a great value
Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras
UGH
There is a thumb grip in the upper right hand corner to help not drop it
Also some of the batteries listed are not for the FZ-70
Nikon Coolpix S8100
No manual controls: I didn't buy this for the manual controls (its a point & shoot remember, get your Binford 5000 25pound mucho $$$ rig out for the tricky stuff), I just want to whip it out,  take pictures and video, and it does that well
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
It is pretty annoying and I'm thinking that pretty soon the flash is going to fall off the camera or break
It's a little larger than most models but it still is carried in my front jean pocket at all times
This has necessitated retaking some pictures where the flash was not fully up
splash !
Overall for it's size though it's tough to beat this
I actually find it annoying, but got used to it quickly (now I just don't spin it all)
Disappointing
the others were not good competitors at quick focus and holding the focus while hand held at the max zoom
Great camera that I`ve ever seen
I looked at the P530 and L830, and Canon SX510
I'm still very happy with it
I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
Amazing
It all depends what you're looking for, of course, but if you want something that takes very, very good pictures but for whatever reason you can't handle the weight and size of the DLSR, this camera is an excellent compromise
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
This is not for the professional photographer
Primarily I leave it on intelligent auto focus, and have no worries
Am totally happy with it
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
Other than that, it takes great photos and is easy to use
Canon says it's normal.
I am really happy to have it
I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7
As as all-around mega-zoom, the similarly priced Canon SX-50 puts it to shame in IQ, image stabilization, better scene modes, a better (articulated) LCD, Zoom Assist / Zoom Framing Assist Lock, much better factory software, and so forth
If you're going to stare at a camera's LCD screen all day maybe this isn't the camera for you but if you want GREAT IMAGES then definitely buy this camera
(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
The only complaint I have with this camera is the video
I like the weight and feel of my camera
upgraded from an PowerShot SX260
My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish
Others have mentioned and tested the camera hardware and image quality ad infinitum, so I only want to point out several items that haven't been mentioned in other reviews:1
I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip
It should be impossible to do that but with some extra bracing, the sharp images were close to all of the time
First of all
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
But it would be better priced at around $50 -- not almost $200
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
It couldnt even do good recognition sometimes leaving the pictures blurry
Great for getting a quick series shot, instead of a burst of shots (good for getting a single shot of a quick moment)
Only problem is the film has to be purchased online
Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera (White)
The Sony Alpha 3000 is a hybrid camera that combines the internals and lens mount of its NEX line with the look and feel of a DSLR
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
It is certainly worth the money
Couldn't be happier
I read reviews and it met all my expectations
The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
I am hoping to experiment more and get some very good results from this camera, INDOOR and outdoor
So I went for this one, hoping that I would see a dramatic improvement
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
It takes a little more time but that's fine with me
Excited at the beginning but get bored and limited by the product
The eyepiece for the EVF is hard plastic so eyeglass wearers would find that uncomfortable and doesn't block stray lights
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
You can even print multiple copies
BRIGHT LIGHTWith daylight, images are beautiful and sharp
Stay clear of the DMC FZ70 Panasonic camera and buy the Cannon
The AMAZING feature about this camera is that you can take the pictures, print them for small cute wallet size instant pictures, AND save the images to your computer like a digital camera
I bought this camera for shooting video, the lens and quality are great, the price was perfect for what I needed
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
my son loves it
The AI setting does a great job even in low light conditions, it's easy to use, and battery life is excellent
I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
stop on it for more depth of field
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
The flash is the downside to this camera
When you have a really nice camera, I think you inherently want to learn more about the art of photography and I've signed
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
My only grip is that taking panoramic shots requires software to piece the images together later (image names for panoramic shots get names )
First, if your expectations are reasonable, I think most will be happy with this camera
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
I wanted a camera that was easy to use - no swapping out lenses or tricky settings
It  has  a very fast processor,  long optical zoom
The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting)
The battery has great endurance
Although this camera is bigger than I wanted, I already have a Canon, I love the quality of the photos, color, sharpness
Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera
you can see the moon and every detail perfectly
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
got this as it flew off the shelves.
I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship
Making sure there is sufficient inter-shot overlaps and the perspective distortion of the overlapping areas
Fun that I have not had with photography in a long time
I'm still discovering its numerous features
Uses the Sony &#34;E&#34; mount which makes the full line of their &#34;E&#34; lenses useable on the camera
it takes great pictures .
Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
Thirdly, I didn't like the grip on the camera
No other point and shoot can top this camera
I take a lot of pictures of my granddaughter and she's moving
You will need to get a memory card to help with storage of pictures, but all in all a good and fun camera
Also seems to have issues focusing sometimes at the end of the zoom
I love the camera, but it is much different that my other Lumix FZ cameras, and I really really needed an owners manual to take to Yellowstone with me the day after I got it
I have also ordered and started using the DMW-LT55 lens with the adapter, you need an adaptor to use the long range lens and I cant even express how great my photos are
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
Nikon S8100
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
Its very expensive from Canon ($35+), I have a cheap knock-off that lasts almost as long and cost $6
9) The resolution at high zoom and ability to take pictures in low light is excellent, BUT, unfortunately, if you want a clear picture in low light, you have to hold it pretty still, so the image stabilization is still weak
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
I added a 50SX about a year ago to have the larger 50 zoom
In particular in bright sunlight I could not see the picture well enough for precise cpmpositions
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
Impressive
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
It was much better than the 28
Awesome camera
YOU CAN BE a artistic pro with the CREATIVE SHOT option which with 1 push of the shutter button gives you 6 different shots, with different effects, and different crops and zooms
Any person not getting what they want from this camera, is expecting WAY too much
More detail. More natural color.
This is not suppose to be a high end, high resolution camera  - it is suppose to be fun, instant and a great way to have some quick pics
Speaking of the flash,  there is also undocumented, that the flash is indeed a pop-up, however it is a manual pop-up
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
Just go with Picasa for photo organizing and light editing and Photoscape for more robust editing
Now for the not so good part
I purchased this camera after seeing one in use on a trip to Costa Rica where it was excellent in capturing birds and monkeys in the forest canopy
We purchased it at our local retailer and had a good experience with it
This camera produced better pictures than my friend's Rebel
This is not a small camera - has look and feel of a good SLR at a much more reasonable price point
I couldnt have purchased a better one
It's great for those school programs when the lighting is dark
Only complaint is the weird little flash that pops up under your fingers, but that's not a big deal once it's open
Excited to use this as my side arm
Other than that, I love this camera.
Although it has a lot of neat features, it didn't deliver on true color quality, especially indoors, moving or fairly still pets, or outdoors in my rose garden (which was surprising, since it did much better on closeups of the roses)
2)User friendly memory
So I hold the camera in both hands, raise my hands and bend my elbows and look at the screen to line up my shot
- battery must be charged in camera, which means attached to the cord
What I was not crazy about:-The GPS tagging is mostly a gimmick; it actually depends on an app on your phone, which records GPS position and date/time
the pictures are asome, the zoom is the best, and have take some full moon pictures that you can see tha craters
Now in the book it says something about pushing the button halfway down and the focus button
That's like all my other cameras EVER, and its a 10x zoom, not 3x or 4x) So, video  works  good when you compare zoom distance to light collection
The interchangeable lenses, compatible with the Nex series, make this truly versatile and a great entry into the prosumer market
No real contenders in its size / price range
1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical image
I had considered a D-SLR, however this camera is all I need, and then some
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
Plus I like using the viewfinder for stability when shooting long (bracing the camera against your face helps stabilize it)
The things that jumped out at me most:+Excellent image quality from a proper sensor, little noise at 1600 ISO or lower
Spectacular camera, terrible computer interface
I was pretty disappointed and decided to return it
the prints are beautiful !
My mechanically deficient wife is using it so much that I believe I will have to get another for myself
I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile
The quality of the pictures isn't perfect, but they are good enough
Give the gift of instant pictures to your family and friends right on the spot
Although the ability for the camera to take a picture based on the introduction of a face, a face smiling or winking is pretty slick
0 inch view
Have used the camera already, and find it to be everything it should be
So much more you can do than just pictures
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
We had a photo guest book so people could take their own pictures and put them in our book
This camera is in every way awesome
), I had to limp by for a few days recording everything to the internal memory, which surprisingly was doing quite well keeping up with my ultra happy shutter finger
But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
It's lighter and smaller, the zoom lens covers about as much territory as you can use without a tripod, and the image quality is significantly better
the included memory card is too small .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
It takes "OK" photos- good but the color and focus never seems quite correct, especially when taking pictures that require a long depth of field
One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it
Great camera and so far I have no complaints on it at all
I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
all metal, but light enough and sized right to slip into a shirt pocket
-Yes the power on button is small, but i can always get it turned on even when i have tactical gloves on
Instead, it is a nice looking but fairly vanilla point and shoot
It i truly an excellent camera with very powerful features and almost all DSLR type capabilities which you will need to capture the special moments in your daily life
Very good and reliable cameraQuality of picture is so nice and easy to useNice body too Thanks sony
It took unbelievable pictures and the size is perfect to put in your pocket
Great camera for on the go people
The zoom seems fine as well
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
Performance is exceptional compared to my earlier point-and-shoot (although the sensor size is identical), daylight pics are great, and the low-light problems that I was experiencing with the older S230 have disappeared
have seen and used various brands/styles, film (slides and prints, different kinds of films) and digital
After taking a few photos, the mechanism for processing the photos seems to be on the blink and I am getting a white band of mottled colour on the lower half inch of the photo
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
I am no professional photographer so I am happy I can get a grat picture with the touch of a button and I don't have to play with the settings or anything
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
I just expected it to be a little better
Very satisfied with the camera and the transaction with Amazon
Pictures come out so clean and clear even in the dark lighting (zero light) at night
Even in low light, I never had to use a flash
Great Camera
i am very pleased with it so far .
makes for a great toy out with friends or parties
I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
This camera was purchased for a disabled person who has tendency to drop things
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
It is very easy to use and has a good zoom on it
I did actually purchased the camera
Great for vacation snapshots
The pictures we have taken so far are so crisp and clear it will blow you away
But if you already have a 4/3rds, or DSLR
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
If you are looking for a good general camera with great optics, look no further
audio on video also lacking .
Bought this camera as a refurbished item at a really good price
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
That being said, they do last a long time but be sure to keep some spares
Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes
You get a beautiful pan shot
I like it
Excellent Camera for the Price
Also, there are no instructions as to how to format a SD card
People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion
Better than their previous version
Great camera so far
However, I can't go halfway around the world and lose priceless memories to a camera that somehow easily gets scratched or won't operate without doing voodoo
I am very pleased with my purchase.
a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier
But it'd print one picture and then say load paper even though there was an entire pack just loaded in
My wife and I are very pleased with this compact camera
sure .
I've never used a View FInder so I don't miss that
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
You should pay attention to the term &#34;MIRRORLESS&#34; in its description
Some have complained of battery life, but I found them to last a really long time
At this price point, you can't go wrong
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
I took a series of identical shots with both cameras and found the the Lumix had vastly better low-light images, with more detail coming through
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
I can't give it a full 5 stars since the battery life could be better
CONS:1) Picture quality is not always the best, you have to learn what setting works for what scene
The picture quality is sharp and crisp and my friends think it's the coolest thing ever since sliced bread
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
Takes beautiful pictures
It's rather a Sony's NEX camera in a SLR body
Great camera
meaning when it needs the flash it has a message in the view finder or the LCD screen to open the flash
Charge lasts a long time
however the special features are wondrous
It is amazing
The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
Love the zoom
The two speed zoom was nice, easy to control and fairly quiet
It starts up quick and is very quick between shots
A great buy
On the other hand, when wide-open, the new lens provides slightly better aperture
If you're looking for a mid priced p&s; with great image quality then I would recommend this camera
After owning this camera for a month and have taken hundreds of pictures and many movies I can say its a great camera for under $200
6) It labels videos as "images" so that when you want to replay or delete them, it's confusing, and you might accidentally delete a video thinking it's an image
For a $200 range camera, try to avoid expecting too much from zoom without a tri-pod but even still know that the picture is not going to be perfectly clear zoomed all the way to 34x
I guess I will have to post more as I learn and experiment with the camera
I take my camera everywhere.
Easy to work
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
Really want to like Nikon but not sure I can buy from them again
All have taken nice pictures in well lit situations
great camera , great investment !
You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality
Having a nice case is key too
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
Not soft
Digital
They are so fast, and virtually no waiting
I just got my new camera, I am not a expert in the matter, but I am VERY HAPPY  with this Nikon camera
(4) Writing images, even with a high speed memory card, is very slow
It took decent picture at short and medium focus lengths
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
Excellent camera
I liked the weight of the camera and easy to carry with me
The camera responce is VERY quick.
User beware and remember to bring several extra batteries for long photo shoots
worth buying, films are cheap too
The various levels of megapixel quality is great
I had issues with seeing the screen in bright light and it's easier for me the zero in on the subject faster with the viewfinder
I had high hopes for this camera as a simple one for my wife to use
Pictures are great
It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos
I received this camera for Christmas and love it
Battery life is ok, more than 250 pictures with a full charge and the camera always on
the quality is superb .
i bought this last week through amazon .
I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
Nice camera for the price
The zoom is outstanding - optical to x60 excellent and the digital iZoom doubles this with no loss in image size and manageable loss in quality, there is more digital zoom on top of this but then noise really starts to become unacceptable
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
I'm a midrange amateur photographer, upgrading from an earlier Olympus 3mp digital
Love the Nikon Coolpix S8100
It was nice
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it
It takes good pictures, they aren't the great pictures you've seen by really expensive professional cameras but I really can't complain about the clarity of any of my pictures
It's a little jewel.
jpg and the dslr shooting
Time from power-on to first shot is good
I doubt there is a better camera for the money
Everything seems great so far
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
Nice photo quality
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
However, it does not have rechargable batteries which is a big must for me
0-Inch LCD (Black)
Love this camera
The images are sharp
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality
The 'intelligent Auto' setting is just amazing and the autofocus is very customizable and very fast
The Sony mentioned below has been incredible, taking great shots and creating wonderful images all in a compact package
I am going to work on my picture taking skills, and report back to you after I know what I'm supposed to do with all these bells a whistles
Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it
(5) This camera takes very, very good photos
Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
Top notch
The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
The viewing screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight
I'm using a 32Gig Class 10 SanDisk HC Ultra Memory card from Best Buy for $24 and it will allow me to take over 3000 photos
I bought it as a gift and I almost swapped it with my Olympus when I saw the great pictures that it produced
PICTURES AND VIDEO AT THE SAME TIME
If you're on a budget and want to get an interchangeable lens camera without necessarily going full DSLR, this nicely fits in your niche
All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
I Love My Sony
It works well for that and also for interior shots
It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body
Remember to buy a memory card too
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
Didn't like it
photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
Some photos do not show up because they are too high resolution (12MP is where I maxed out
awesome
Close up is awesome
The -4 to +3 5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera
I took shots of water propulsion system in action from 1/4 mile away and they all came out great
Inexpensive camera has amazing zoom feature
Excellent camera for the price point
Canon take note:  I'd love a camera with Less options for those of us who just want to stick mostly to Auto but better low light photos & a panorama option
The flash quality is good too
It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip
The camera does all I need and wanted
It takes great pictures, is a good size, and works quickly
Not a great camera for action or concerts
The flash works beautifully, the red eye feature is good, the pictures are very sharp and clear
3, It uses 4 AA batteries
Many bought the camera without downloading the operator's manual or checking out professional reviews first
(the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery)
Once I play with the settings just right it takes amazing pictures
The resolution of the close-ups is fantastic and the zoom, non-flash shots are also fabulous
They won't last
it is a little bit heavier and bigger than what I had expected a mirrorless camera would be, but still way lighter and smaller than a regular DSLR
On a bright note, the camera did take good indoor shots with nice color and flash distribution
This is the lastest purchase for me in the PowerShot line of cameras
In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera
OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
It was my first time to shoot manual at a concert
3 OSS Lens for $200
This is one model that does not allow for a remote shutter release
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
This one fits the bill beautifully
Too big for alternate camera
I'm really enjoying having a camera so small and lightweight
The softness of the kit lens is quite evident when paired with the T5
the g3 looks like a work of art !
Zoom and Burst Shooting a Big Disappointment
The paper prints so well that it looks old-fashioned still
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
Sharp results against complex landscapes
I received this camera as gift in December
I heard a lot of great reviews, and decided to buy it
Excelent price,
I purchased this Panasonic LUMIX Digital Camera for my husband, as a Christmas gift
I used this for my trip to Spain and Italy
High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
Was just out in Colorado for 2 weeks and took lots of pictures
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
This Nikon s8100 a just a little bigger and heavier (10x Zoom) than the Canon IS1100, 1200, 1300, 1400s (3x Zooms), needs a "slightly" bigger case
All in all I am delighted with this camera
great camera for the price
While the size made it super portable, I needed something with more zoom capability and a better lens for low light conditions
great &#34;bridge&#34; type camera
Guess Nikon hasn't figured out how to make a good  10x zoom lens weigh less than a  gram, darn those guys
BAD PRINT QUALITY
This is a great camera for the price and it take great pictures
My still pictures of hummingbirds are praised by all who see them
I doubt you will find its equal without spending at least twice as much
At times its a bit bright (so you really have to play with settings)
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
It's really high rez
I accidentally bumped it once and all the papers fell out
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
Used the Camera for holiday photos and all were great, and almost never used the flash because it wasn't necessary
Very good with its focus
This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
will be taking to sons college graduation
Pictures are very low quality
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
It doesnt have any manual controls so if you are looking for pro features this isnt for you
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
Being as I know you need to use manual setting under the lights and I have yet to learn that the still shots at night were just as great, motion not so much but that's user error not the camera
Great camera / value
Crisp pictures, easy to you use, and the battery life is the best I've come by
In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not
I was hoping to get a point-n'-shoot camera that would take wonderful pictures better than my current Panasonic or Nikon P
Too early to fully rate this camera yet but a little dissatisfied
It has a built in macro lens for shooting small objects/flowers/insects
Blah camera
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
Simple, easy to use
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future
Can anyone give your opinion in the difference of cameras and photo quality of both the SX50 and FZ70,, at the 20mm and 1200mm
While this camera is nice and takes decent pictures, I just couldn't deal with the size of it
Also, the camera has enough manual settings to get some really nice shots
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
Compact, great features, and takes very sharp, excellent photos
Result is vibrant picture
Great photo quality, but durability sucks
First thing you'll notice - this camera can deal with low-light like no other compact camera
As for the kit, Cameta ripped me off: the little tripod reeks this nasty WD40 smell I've smelt in many cheap electronics which causes headaches and nausea, STRONG nausea, the cheap secondary battery died in days, and they wouldn't give me a return shipping label
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
But I found a charger with a car adapter and a 2nd Nikon battery for only $26 here on Amazon so that takes care of that
I miss the "flipping the screen" option that is on the FZ50
Maybe
Love both cameras
They also have the ability to take video
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
It was great as long as it was working
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
Some people have been complaining that it feels a bit flimsy & like a toy camera
My frustration was in uploading the images
It took them 45 minutes to answer one question, including the time it took them to give me the answer to a question someone else asked
Wish it had a view finder, but most point and shoots don't
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
Most of them are blurry
I have not been disappointed
Auto scene mode doesn't pick the right scene indoors in low light (wants to use night landscape), use Regular Auto in that situation
I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a simple camera
However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
When the FZ 35 came out the following year, I bought it
Great camera
And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
Camera began to scroll, erratically, at about day 100
I bought it for my wife as a gift,and she likes it so it was an excellent buy
The low light shooting is great for a point & shoot
I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
So please, read the specs on this because I can't explain what they mean anyway
I brought replacement batteries and they got me by for another week, and then those died too
The tilt out screen is a nice feature that I did not know I wanted until I had it
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
This camera is amazing
As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
The preset modes can also be manipulated to produce high contrast and backlit effects, among others I have yet to fully explore
The wide angle is so sharp, it rivals my DSLR
I saw my 10-year old bury his head in the manual for a moment or two & proceed to snap off a few zoomed frames overlooking the peninsula
Easy to use, great pictures
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
Love this camera
poor bulid quality
Second Nikon S8100 camera takes no better pictures than the Pentax Optio S45 camera that I already have
that meant even less light and just as much action .
I haven't taken a bad picture with it yet
This is my 4th P&S in recent years and is the best
blurry
Bottom line - i think the professional reviewers were paid by another company to push their camera, and am very glad i tested all of the contenders before purchasing
Mediocre Image Quality
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
On the head-shoulder shots, you could see Adam Levine's frown lines and crows feet, no noise, it was awesome
Thank you Santa!
But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good
The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
I can also take multiple pictures in rapid succession
The zoom was amazing
This camera is awesome and deserves a 5+ star rating
Easily fits into my waterproof case for taking out kayaking
I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
The only place I could find this camera was on Amazon
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
Being a brand loyalist, I started with a Canon Powershot SX130IS
Definitley puts my buddies cameras to shame, and they all paid in the same price range
Took great photos using max zoom from right field with no tripod
This camera performs really well in multiple conditions
I would have given it a 5star if not for the size
I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm)
The body is very cheap
The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
Although the model is considerably big, I have used original Polaroid models and I love this one so much better
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
I thought not having the great very wide angle lens and the sweep panorama was ending my photography career
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
The fact that is digital makes a lot better then the old polaroids that required film
Amazing Camera
I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
Super Travel Camera for Long-Distance
great job canon !
Delighted
I recommend it for someone wanting a simple to use camera, great pics, low light, 10x zoom and stereo 1080p video
right?  Also, some may "gently" suggest that I quit whining and splurge on a DSLR or something - and I would agree - but I've seen pictures from a point-n-shoot Canon SX120 of kids in dimly lit rooms and they came out sharp every time
If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use
I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
I could forgive the lack of control if the image quality was spectacular, but it is far from it
Plus the extra battery life is so useful
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
Put the batteries that came with it in, and shot a T ball game, senior pictures for a friend, and went to a local botanical garden since I received it on Thursday, and still has plenty of juice left
Takes some really killer macro photos and zoomed photos and thus far I am impressed
Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
only complaint-the neck strap is kind of narrow and uncomfortable, but that's an easy fix
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
This is great
a friend got this same camera (from Best Buy) and it quit working properly within about a month
Definitely recommend
It has an articulating LCD screen and the LCD screen has more pixels I really recommend it over this camera and it's even cheaper
The automatic mode does it all
The image stabilization is excellent
I was really stressed about which type of camera to buy and was unsure on if this camera would work
Oh, BTW, (as others point out) the USB cover FEELs flimsy (I couldn't really care less about this
The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
Oh, and the zoom is beyond awesome, love it
Very nice and compact with the easy of use for features but almost all picture were blurry when used on stand or taken by camera in hand
You can get crisp, beautiful pictures in low lit restaurants without flash (provided little movements on your subjects part) free hand
I like that you can choose the photos you want to print instead of printing every shot; the photo paper is conserved for the images you really want printed and you can keep others you don't
I love that I no longer have to lug around my camera (suit)case
Unfortunately this camera seriously lacks in one major category that is important to certain people
If you want a fun camera that helps you shares memories in a unique way, I recommend this camera
So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]
(6) Face recognition actually works
I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
I had been searching for a new camera for some time
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
The size of the camera is perfect.
Controls are easy and intuitive
There is a T5 and a T5i and it's not easy to tell what the differences are
We enjoy the 8100, we had an 8000 and it was great also
the friend lovedd ita little bulkier than expected
That is quite a claim, but I be leave it's true
Again, I don't mind relying on auto and scene modes on a point and shoot but those modes have to do at least a decent job of interpreting the scene
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70
Buy it, you will love it.....
After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised
Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC
It cannot overcome dim lighting
Great camera
I was wrong
Although I only have had this a few weeks it is a very nice camera
I do like having the saturation button at my fintertips though so maybe i'm really not on the fence
The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder
Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
That is, until it started saying "Mode dial is not in the proper position
jpg format), unfortunately when shooting against a dslr  with this in
This is quite a nice little camera
Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix
This one is perfect
We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible
Son's Christmas Gift
What a great little camera
I wasted $74
Nice pics, weak lens cover
A couple of years ago I bought a small point-and-shoot (S230) which worked very well when outdoors in good light and was very, very portable, fitting easily into any pocket I had
Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding
I bought my wife one after she lost her camera somewhere
otherwise this is one nice camera,  shooting at night from  a moving car thru the glass  really outstanding, settings more than enough, adjustable
There are plenty of adjustments to get great pictures and I guess if you want more adjustments then maybe you should think about a DSLR
I'm taking pictures like a pro these days
We were at the Niagara Falls and even the evening pictures of the Falls turned out great, I was surprised
Being sure the image stabilizer is on if very difficult to ascertain
Everything else is pretty standard
Besides that
I would like to recommend this camera to my friends
Great compact and effective
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
The only near negative is that the view screen is hard to see in bright sun while doing video
the movie mode is also working great .
Disappointed
Camera for Cabo
Great pics and easy to use
CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera
I hope they pay Ashton Kutcher alot for his advertising because thats what lead me to this camera
Not only will the price be better, but you might find the earlier model still has all the features you want
It is easy to focus and just point and shoot
First, the still photos are extremely high quality
This camera far exceeds my expectations
At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom
Don't have to do any image editing straight out of the cameraImages are sharpLighting is accurate, and the camera resolves high contrast very well in dummy mode (ie Full Auto)It has a Viewfinder
Great picks, hard to up load
The Nikon COOLPIX L830 was my choice
My fault but I will be getting another
Need to purchase memory
That's what I wanted and hoped for
The charging system means you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it
Panasonic website shows Leica lens which is NOT on FZ70
10 great price for all the features .
I am positive the lens wasn't bumped while it was extended so it is just an unreliable mechanism
Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact
You can also take pictures during videoing
Battery life, not as good as others, but OK
This zoom should be illegal
The 20mm wide shots are amazing
The lens has a great range to it, the wide angle is indispensable
Pros: Terrific form factor, brilliant LCD screen, 10x optical zoom, usual Nikon quality, support, warranty
I love the overtly quick zoom capabilities it has, never having to struggle with a locked in zoom that sometimes results in missing a very special shot
The camera comes with everything you need to get started, and includes a very helpful handbook with illustrations and all you need to know about this product
Service, and quality sucked
Took this camera on a trip and absolutely loved the use of it in the canyons and on my favorite trails
(3) OUTSTANDING low-light no-flash performance
The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack
The image quality and price both align to this middle of the spectrum range, and for a 20MP APS-C sensor this is a great value
Cons:- Battery life
Works Great
On my old Fujifilm S700, the flash auto popped up when needed
It is perfect for what I need
It's fun just to take to a party to record for memories and to actually print out the picture in front on your friends/ family will blow their mind
they take excellent macro shots as well .
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
Five Stars
Very reasonably priced
Great skin color
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
Here's a tip though
If you want a very light camera, with more battery life and to save some money, the T5 is excellent
It is only a little bit inconvenient that in order to review your pictures you have to move over the little slider to the playback option, much like older cameras, rather than a playback button - but that's just a minor complaint
Hey, guess what?
The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
I haven't had the camera for a very long so I am still learning about it, but the camera is easy to use and takes great pictures, which is what I bought the camera for
So, in summary
I have experimented with some of the special features while reading the manual
Great Price for Quality Camera
My smartphone might do better in low light
Very easy to use and the preview screen is large
Great Alternative To My DSLR
Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom
The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands
I would recommend it
But, the product was intact, brand new and with all other packaging items
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
Two cameras ago I had a Nikon coolpix that was a very good camera (this was about 6-7 years ago)
It works well in low-light and takes videos worthy of all your family memories
Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
I read some negative reviews about the service dept
Better if optical image stabilization at higher zoom levels was improved
Definitely a good investment.
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
Bottom line, this camera captures the image I want captured; every time, in stunning quality
i have not got around to reading the instructions, the fine print is hard to see,i have a  best friend that has one so will get him to get me started
We received the product and within 1 month it was already broken
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
Mine died after only 2 days
That food in the camera and after four shots, it said the card was full
Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos
The pictures are awesome, and I would not have had it fixed for that price except, if the USB/AV port is bad, you cannot upload photos OR charge the battery
User manual is not printed, it is on a cd which is a bit of an inconvenience but saves trees :)
It doesn't even give you a numerical percentage anywhere
This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings
Exceeded my expectations
It is a bit on the heavy, bulky side but I don't mind it much
Great telescoping lense, big viewing screen, compensates beautifully for movement and has easy to understand settings
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
Enough said
The video also has more artifacts than the NEX or alpha cameras
I highly recommend this product (my mom and my sister both bought one)
But believe me, it's well worth it.
First let me say that I was impressed by all of the features listed
I find it easy to use, the pictures excellent
A really nice feature you don't take into consideration until you're in that predicament
The LCD is great, but annoying as all heck in bright conditions
MUCH TO LEARN BUT THE AUTOMATIC SETTING CAN DO MOST OF WHAT IS NEEDED
Thanks for Canon Camera great and small in size and the most beautiful pictures of the property Send Mobile and zoom Excellent
2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
Great Camera
always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix
It is, of course, not covered by warranty -- after 4 months
4- Looks great.
AND it's all in a cute little compact package
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
Yes, as some of the reviewers have pointed out, there are some design issues maybe, some things that could be better, but overall, I have been very pleased
Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
Excellent Battery Life Good Value
Only thing is can't figure out how to take a pic without the red flash even if I turn off red eye function
The camera is everything if not more than I expected, the quality is tops
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
Defective video recording: uses too much battery
The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
I am not the world's best photographer and I wasted many an instant camera in high school due to my lack of skills
The finish of the camera has a nice tactile feel to it, and the next strap, while not high end, is comfortable enough
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
3rd Canon SX series with lens or lens cover hang ups
You just need to learn about the camera and what the different scenes and adjustments do
I did not intend to use the digital zoom but did so by accident and was amazed at the quality when compared to the optical at 60x
By bumping down to 2048x1536 you can dramatically speed this up to 5 sec, and you can get a really quick cycling by using the tiny 640x480 resolution
This camera is very easy to use
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
It takes excellent photos, easy to use, great zoom, and fast
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
No doubt a great value
I have had Canon and Olympus products and they do not even compare
And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also
Battery is Useless
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
Finally, the software Nikon supplies is lousy
It has a good optic, nice 10x zoom, very sharp and detailed LCD, VR, wide angle lens and a perfect look
- lag or hesitation where I try to take a picture quickly but it won't focus and therefore won't take the picture (usually after I just turned it on but sometimes randomly)
exactly what it's purported to be
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
however i realized that when in a situation where i knew a flash may be needed, i could just open it up
Sony A3000 - great entry level camera at an even greater price
I haven't got the hang of that yet, so I will have to read the book
- OVERLY AGRESSIVE NOISE REDUCTION: I'd much rather do the retouching on my computer and be selective about how much to apply, and where
I thought I'd thoroughly researched replacement brands/models, and this Nikon S8100 was my best choice
At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
the glue simply didnt hold
If you're looking for a great entry level point and shoot camera with many advanced features then you can't go wrong
UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for
[EDIT:] addressed in comment, thanks
four megapixels is great .
Good enough for me
but I managed to get a clear picture at night with no light except for that from a tv on the opposite side of a large room
I read that in other reviews but thought it would be worth it if I was careful
Great camera--great price
She never reads the instruction manuals for any of our electronics, but picked it up and started using it day 1 w/o issue
I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
-Takes amazing panoramas
I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks
What I saw were very clear/crisp photos which appeared to be somewhat on par with my Panasonic FZ70
I love it
Battery life fair
Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
It takes great shots, photo printouts are excellent quality for my wife who is an artist
Get one today
This camera also had problems with the autofocus when  used on a very cold day (about 10 degrees F)
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
April 30, 2014Although I have a fair amount of experience with 35mm SLR photography, this is my first "non-pocket" digital camera
Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
Photo and screen quality are amazing, zoom is impressive for a compact camera, the navigation wheel is very handy and startup is quick
All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
The first time I had owned the camera less than a week
Really jumps out there for zoom lens with no distortion
The size is tiny, which I love.
Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
After several clips I check the battery status and it shows almost full
For example, I took a picture our of a car window, and the edges of the side view mirror (integral to the picture) have lines across them
Don't use alkaline batteries
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
Like it
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
For a camera in its class it does a great job with both of the features I mentioned just know it is simply not going to have the abilities of a camera like say the Canon EOS Rebel T3i or above
I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
Not the Same
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
looks nice, works OK
) will do a better job
The viewfinder remains the same
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
My "disappointment" is due to the fact that this model DOES NOT HAVE A LEICA LENS
When I share pics with my friends on Facebook they always want to know what kind of camera I used
On the bright side, having everything in focus is usually ideal for family or documentary photos
Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills
The camera was larger than expected, But once I started using the different options I was amazed by the quality of the pictures and ease of use
It is a nice product in it's category, wide angle to super tele in one lens
The video works great also and zoom works equally well for the video
for this price that was awesome
It even has built in tops to help you take great pictures
The viewfinder picture is a bit less clear than I would like and somewhat small but manageable
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
Beware of SD card compatibility
Good Camera - Still Learning Features
So I decided to upgrade, not to a professional camera, but to a better one
It does have a useful, though low-resolution panorama mode for those who don't want to make the effort to combine multiple photos using image processing software
Very bad for video
expensive
The other downside is the video: It does take good video quality, but the mic picks up the zoom and auto focus
The Price is Right
made the camera totally inoperable .
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
I don't mind the slighly large size
( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do
Attractive and nicely finished, plus the weight and heft in general is perfect for me as it lets me know I have something in my hand that I can control
I bought this camera from another retailer because it was available before Amazon
I would like to also have a instant picture camera but after trying out this one, I think I'm done trying to search for another one
I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now and have shot about 1500 photos with it
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
Excellent point and shoot, with 1 star removing flaw
The film has poured out so many times its annoying messy and completely inconvenient
It has a lot of options for photos
Also have Pentax, Nikon, Kodak cameras (SLRs and P&S;)
, , very cheap
No chance of dust and stuff getting in the camera,especially on windy days
I was willing to sacrifice some additional weight and size to get that
Viewfinder works well asalternative
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
The quality of the instant prints are just fine
Since it came from Amazon, every aspect of the purchase came off without a hitch
It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
I really can't complain about this camera
Makes the foray from automatic cameras and point & shoots almost effortless
Great camera for a great price
You do get a few cool options, like color selection when taking photos, and a few frames when you print the pictures
Of course this happened right after the warranty expired, and Nikon's website said they could fix it for a price
Nice camera
but it does make it a worthy consideration if you are shopping on a tight budget
Instead of the 9 FPS as advertised, I could only get 3, then wait, refocus, then 3 more
Well satisfied
Great camera that takes great pictures
You will find a lot of my S8100 pictures at [
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review
For a new $350 camera I expected better
I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan
The lens was not as good as I expected
Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
The prints are pretty good, though definitely not film quality
The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
As someone who normally goes straight to Canon, I am surprised by how strongly I am recommending it
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
great camera
But over all I give this a definite 9/10
Nikon S8100This camera is a pleasure to review and I can't say enough to describe what a superb instrument it is to use
The 60x times optical zoom is like having aportable telescope
I've had this camera for three years.
I delt with it because the shots were good and I spent 250
yes, a Sony
I am satisfied
takes great pics close up and far away
I don't mind the cheap plastic
She really likes that the pictures double as stickers
The colors are fantastic on the pictures that I print although they are a little bit off they are still very accurate
I use this in my classroom
This camera has broken twice on me
Here's my update
This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation
Now I need to learn how to use some of the special features on it
I have used this camera for 4 months, taken it on 4 trips - 1 beach, 1 cruise, 1 city, 1 nature/camping
If you currently shoot DSLRs, this is a good camera for when you want something light and simple to pack along with you rather than bringing all your gear
owned this camera for roughly 3 months and now its not working I keep getting a lens error and the camera has never been dropped
The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony
I have been able to order some off Amazon but if I run out, I cannot just go to the store and get more
the zoom for this camera is great with a high focus and you can take photos in any light conditions and the photos will still be sharp and clear , i have bought this camera to take with me on a vacation and i have made the correct choice when buying this camera
Excellent
I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
My brother can use my Nikon Coolpix L830 and even likes it but he struggles like a gaint trying to change the a new borns diaper
I couldn't use it the entire trip
This is the best I've seen a superzoom do with standard indoor lighting
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
You pay for what you get, and this pocket size camera is worth every penny
The S8100 does most everything else very well though
Great camera, until it stopped working
This is NOT your father's/grandfather's camera/camera company
I was just looking for a camera to take decent pics of the kids, and I wanted to stay within the $300 range
With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used
Can't wait to use it on our vacation and take just amazing pictures
It only worked when the camera was plugged in
I had purchased the sx280 for a family member to use on a trip to Europe
We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
Easy to use
If there is a lot of ambient noise, and you're careful about this, you won't notice
In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum
I wanted a simple but good quality picture taking camera
no instructions .
Love this camera
This is a very nice camera
Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera
thank you
everything else about the camera is great .
Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors
I gave four stars rather than five because I would have preferred a rechargeable battery
The good news is that sx700 appears to be what the 280 was supposed to be and more, with better quality and no evidence of the same video/auto shut off problems that plagued the 280
Image stabilization is not even close to the same level as a DSLR or even the Olympus OM series
This is SO easy to use
needed mine, wife had it when i needed it
I am so pumped to give this to my girlfriend for her birthday
Anyway, Canon has upgraded the battery capacity so we were able to shoot 12 hour days touring the park at multiple stops without swapping batteries, however, I did disable GPS and NFC radios to avoid drain from those features
great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
One point shy for not having rechargeable battery which isn't all that bad if you're traveling all you need is pop old ones amd replace a sinch
The lens that comes with this camera is ok but it's lowest f-stop is 5 and that is bad in low light situations
The main complaint is the fact that every time I want to remove the memory card or replace the battery with a fresh one, I have to totally remove it from my tripod
There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
I bought this camera as a novelty item but expected something better than a marginal device
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
a few things that might make it even better :
I am not a professional photographer, I don't even qualify as an "aficionado"
Great Price
inconsistent quality
The build quality is great
See comment number 4 below
I was also able to get wonderful short 30 second videos of the wedding ceremony
I have lost more than a few shots fumbling to get the darn thing open
You won't regret it for one minute
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
Don't get me wrong this is a great instant print camera, but it just didnt work like an old polaroid it was more like a camera/compact camera printer, you can choose the pictures you want to print, and view them
It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features

Eventually the power settings kick in and the lens retracts, but every other camera I've seen has a PLAY setting that doesn't engage the lens
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
-Battery life: I wouldn't call it miserable like other reviewers, but it doesn't last a long day; I suggest you to buy a spare
Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between
larry ponziani
Lower the Noise Reduction Setting for Sharper Pics
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
This is a replacement of my SX260
7 picture quality is excellent .
Just point, zoom and shoot
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
Amazing
Love this camera
My Canon has spoiled me because that battery lasts forever
Never a problem and they all produce excellent pictures
The zoom is great, the pictures are awesome
Five Stars
I hope that Sony didn't do that to this camera too
If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot
The battery life is great, the picture quality is great, it is a complete package
Donation
I got it a little over a year ago, and I should have returned it from the get-go
The main downfall I have and the reason for an average rating is because the booklet show a port for a remote but the camera does not have one
AMAZING CAMERA
and I'd be tempted to pay that much
The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects
Camera takes very nice photos
And I've played some with the video
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
And then there's the video
but I am carrying around the bulk and weight of a 60X zoom, and not being able to use that full range effectively
All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
Note: when you first look at the digital display of a picture, you might question the quality, but when you actually upload it to a computer, the picture quality really cleans up and the pics are great
The LCD should be used.
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
this is great for trips afar
A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
The camera is small, light weight and easy to handle, and fits well into my hand
I look forward to using the camera outside in brighter light
Awesome Camera
The whole idea behind this camera is "magazine quality images" for as little money as possible
I love the great, awesome 3 inch 921,000 dot high resolution screen
and that's been for at least 25 years
The photos keep turning out blue
Great camera
I have several different cards, but I really recommend something fast, like an extreme or extreme pro by san disk
The super wide angle is rather unique in a super zoom and great for landscapes and indoor shots
They absolutely love it
easy to use
My wife loves the camera, it is a bit tricky with the flash but you can get use to it
Best Camera
. lens cap is a really annoying
The outdoor shots are great
Now that I am home, the photo quality seems to be pretty good - at least much better than anything you can get with the cell phone
I am really pround of my choice, this is more that I expected, but the camera is large and a little heavy comparing with the others, but I think is because the zoom
I don't know what the deal is but it makes me want to try a different manufacturer next time
However, issues (for me):- this camera is much bulkier than my Canon
As a realtor I was having trouble getting good photos of small rooms and this camera has made things those photos much easier to take
need the speed
The FZ70 60x zoom is a bit much, anything beyond 25x probably needs a tripod
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
Once you do, you will never turn it off
Perfect for our intended use
However, a T2 is a lot cheaper and works better
Vacation is soon and it's going with me
Having said that, it by no means feels rugged
My guess is the camera will perform wonderfully for both stills and video
Got this camera the day before we left on vacation
Haze can actually be an issue with the long zoom, but that is true with any zoom in this range
I am not even an avid photo-bug
Unfortunately, the camera lacks some key capabilities for a camera in it's price range:No auto focus - the 3 zone focus switch found on less expensive Polaroid instant cameras should have been replaced by full auto focus
It's not the smallest camera in the world so don't expect to go unnoticed if you put it in your pocket
Good video too and much moreFor the beginner
Great Camera for the dollar
It is like a little magnet gadget and has a tiny cord that holds the cap while it is off the lens
This is probably due to the actual number of lenses and distance the lenses are able to extend from the camera itself
Deleting images is even slow
This is for my daughters birthday
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
" I'm not sure what this error means, but we couldn't use the camera
I would recommend this to anyone
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
Great videos
I also found the controls annoying, but would have lived with it if it took good pics
I have always had Canon's for a pocket sized camera but really thought this one was it
Very nice camera, only problem is a common problem with all cameras that use only a monitor screen and no viewfinder is that they are very difficult to see on a sunny day
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
I do have only 1 issue
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
I shoot with D3s and D600 Nikons
Poor experience overall
Very good budget camera, even in low light
I have a friend who purchased this and she is a semi professional photographer
I guess if i bought a camera with a 10 mp, I shouldnt expect much
What I love about the product is that you can take photos, store them on memory (internal or an SD card) and then print on-demand
With a bit of effort, a friend and I removed a grain of sand and the camera worked again
Feature packed lightweight camera
this is a wonderful camera .
Nothing wrong, just not that great
3)to take low light pictures without flash I have had to use the continuous feature rather that the low light or party setting which both use flash
It's a great, thought out, fun product
So back it goes
A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS
The t5 seemed to be the right fit for me, more megapixels along with tried and true technology
It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon
Love this camera
Focus is generally fast and able to keep up, and the use of zoom does not cause a loud motor noise like it does in my old camera
That being said - I love, love, love this camera
11) Garbage autofocus in video mode, I think pressing the take a photo button brings it in to focus though, sorry I forgot the name of that thing, strange, I know
The built in flash on this camera (like almost all built in flashes) is harsh distributing light unevenly
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
picture were out of focus all the time; had to return it
;)
So when the S8100 came along I decided to try it and am very glad that I did
More capability here than I would expect for this price
I have a 5-year-old Canon that cost a third as much as this NIkon, but gives me better photos
A better battery door solution is definitely needed for this camera period, I'd take off half a star on my rating if I could
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
if the lense is on or the batteries are low, the camera freezes and you have to turn it off and on
I wish it had broken a month earlier so that I could just return it to Amazon but now we have to deal directly with Nikon, which has been a pain
The onboard menu is easy to understand
I was not in need of a new point and shoot, but it was on a great deal and I had a gift card to burn up so I took a shot
So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
I purchased the DMC-FZ70 after several weeks of research and I must say I am very impressed
I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
I consider this a major inconvenience that prospective buyers should be aware of
The macro shots are great
bucks in my opinion
Works perfect as you ould expect
I was looking for an easy/solid point and shoot, and the L830 came through
Also, you need  a VERY steady hand when shooting
I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
It didn't hurt anything, and left the protective film on the screen,quite invisible
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
The zoom is great
This FZ70 is bulky & gets weighty over the course of the day, but when going between distance & zoom, and between speed shots & low light shots, it is hard to beat
It would be quicker to set my preference
just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done
The Vivitar 1700 mAh work good but this thing eats batteries
i love the quality of the pictures .
Very portable
Poor Design Choices
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
For camera users who have larger hands, the A3000 is indeed much easier to handle than a NEX3N, for example
I thought the pictures would turn out clearer
However, having it raised, and over the lens does reduce red eye
Well, I think that for the most part, I may not be using them much anymore (except for macro work)
absolutely breathtaking .
No problems getting started and no problems with the photo software that came with it
After doing much research I picked this camera to replace my kodak easy share that I got in 2008
Although I was buying a &#34;open box&#34; product I expected that all items would be in the box, however that wasn't the case, the camera was just thrown in the box, battery was loose and there was NO battery charger included
Not comfortable to handle
I've seen much more expensive cameras that deliver a fraction of this camera's abilities and aren't as easy to use
on a HD memory card, because a regular memory card was not capable of filming it
The camera intrigued me because it functions both as a digital and an instant print, and the prints are pretty good quality
Always before when the "white light" started to appear I would have to stop recording because the white line appeared in the video
I highly recommend this camera
This camera was very user friendly and the quality of the photos was great too
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom
In my case, I really love it
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
I cherish all shots in all locations at all times, and the camera's inability to take even relatively-clear pictures has made the camera useless to me
This cam is a very good electronic device
It's all the fun of a polaroid with the benefits of digital
Small enough to put in your handbag and works like a professional camera
I think this camera's options will satisfy most users
I had earlier purchased a Panasonic 18X zoom and was favorably impressed with its optics and functionality
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
Once the flash is open, it's easy to remember where not to place your finger and cover the flash
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
I don't get really good pictures with it
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
A side note for the camera it does not work with SDXC cards, I tried my 64GB card and it would not register it, but a 16GB card works great
* main dial is not backlit .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
Zoom range is one thing, the stabilization is good too
Low light pics: very nice
Previously owned the predecesor L820 and like many say from first glance looks the same but there are multi different specs between these 2 so my review is related to their comparison
You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
I've always loved taking pictures and this camera is so easy to use and takes great pictures
-The flash assembly seems frail I am very happy with this camera and I highly recommend it
Consequently, it's very tough to take pictures in the sunlight
Sound is good on video, pictures are clean and sharp
The only drawback is that it works with AA  batteries but they seem to last long
the Flash doesn't pop-up automatically when needed like other cameras
-Battery Life lasts me about 2 weeks, and ever patrol i go on i am taking pictures, my job requires it
Now the best part of this camera is the 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor
On the other hand, the resolution of both the viewfinder and the rear screen are rather low
My sister is not an accomplished photographer at all, but she found this camera at a local camera store and took it on our trip to Tanzania in February
Pictures are great the rapidfire feature is very good
Fantastic clarity and detail (even when I zoom in on my computer)
I got some cool pictures of Carlsbad Caverns in NM which are minimally lit
I bought 3 of these for my kids
Because of my incredible busy lifestyle, I have not used it a tremendous amount of time
If you can get past those two things, this is a great choice
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
Yep, TRUE
This has caused me to lose some great shots
I could not find the special effects for the colors such as grey etc
I am looking for a compact digital camera for a long time
the compliments are great but the usability and pictures are better
We've had this for almost a year now and the photo quality has been very good
Purchased camera for Christmas
Don't know why, set it on the star 1080(default) and leave it
Lots of modes and features, I've barely explored some of them
Well the prayers were answered because when we looked at the pictures later on a screen I could actually see, they turned out super crisp
Remarkable low-light performance
Easy to use
highly recommended
All is good with this camera thus far
The 300HS is a basic auto camera that fits very nicely in my pants pocket
but i guess that's how it would beit's a polaroid for crying out loud
Poor quality for zoom
Outstanding Camera With Numerous Small Downsides
AMAZON
Battery life seems to be very good as I have been using it
The charger didn't work
Great for pictures as well as for taking movies on the fly
She had a pervious version of this camera and loved it
I am NOT a professional protographer
It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
nikon coolpix S8100
Very disappointing, not what I was used to from Amazon
I found both just fine
I like this one much better
The other 2 things that I'm not happy with, is the charging system and no manual mode
The lens simply can't get enough light at F6
Takes great pictures
Well I really bought it to have some fun with
However, after having been using it often and seeing such wonderful results, I am very satisfied and happy
But the reliability of this camera SUCKS
What I observed through the view screen was stunning
Great buy
It is very easy to use and very compact with professional quality pictures
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
OK, so I bought this camera from Amazon, great service from them, only had this camera 2 days so this is just a first impression
Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
nice, large display, with the flash location not an issue for me at all
Happy wife,happy life
Don't get me wrong--this is no high end DSLR camera
The obvious reason for getting the DMC-FZ70 is for it's amazing 60x optical zoom
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
The only thing I don't like is the case with the magnetic clasp
I am on the fence about the settings buttons and not having a rotating selector switch
So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD
The pop-up flash can trigger the off-camera flash without problem
Poor color accuracy, just average sharpness
lots of great features even for a beginner
Really disappointing
Critiques:1) Flash is in a weird spot - placed right where I would steady the camera with my non-dominant hand
In VIDEO mode the ZOOM is very gentle, like at 1/4 regular speed
that picture alone made the camera worth it
This camera shipped really quickly and will be a really cool gift
For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition
The new SX700 also introduces an interesting feature - Zoom Framing Assist, which should help with composing shots of far distant subjects
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
I've been using this camera for a few months now.
This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
I wanted to like this camera ,but it does not come close to the FZ200 in photo quality
It was a great addition
good points :
The menus could be a little more intuitive and a printed manual would have been great (it's on a disk like all other camera's these days)
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
My dad has the previous gen
Only problem - wireless syncing with computer and smartphone for remote shooting
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
I love this camera
I really expected this camera to make better pictures
She loves it
With great color, good detail capture, decent exposure, and solid (but not class-leading) high ISO performance
Battery life = about a day's worth of off and on use while on a recent vacation
It is now April and my camera is already back to Nikon for repair
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
Nothing protects the lens, so I would suggest getting the case
Great Camera
change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels
Best Camera I Ever Had
you have nothing to lose and much to gain
I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji
easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag
It is so very easy to use and has a lot of awesome features allowing you to take some really nice shots that would normally only be available for a camera that is much more expensive
Much better
Awesome pictures
And, if you don't want the flash on (I avoid using it on this camera), holding your finger over the flash means you'll never be surprised by the flash going off unintentionally
The L830 meets my needs
I have a Nikon D90 for taking exceptional photos and that will be the camera I always go to for professional results
I am just glad I can have a compact camera that takes next to SLR pictures
-The flash is in a funny spot, but i dont get upset about it
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange
Zoom works great, and pics are clear and vivid
The S8100 is easy to use and the pictures are extraordinary
If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
I never use a flash, so the pop-up flash isn't really a bother
I bought a 64gig chip for it
WORKS LIKE A CHARM
Since April, I've replaced them three times
It prints a photo in less than a minute and the quality is exellent
It was annoying having to constantly open the flash when I needed it, even in auto mode
I was let in at the AMA and People's Choice Awards but was told not to use it
I was surprised the author was not more discerning
Better make me happy
Love the details of birds  at 60x
Great Camera at this price point
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
A bit bulky with simple menu options
and the pictures are really very small
This camera does take awesome pictures though and is definitely fun
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
why ?
i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable
Would be nice to have a better LCD)No thumb wheel
And it records full 1080p HD video
My prints came out streaked
The big problem is that the app drains the battery of my Samsung S3 Mini in a few hours
Great
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
The camera takes the best zoom pictures
Video quality is also very good
The good:Colours are very accurate - better than my Nex 3
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
I will never buy another brand again
With that much zoom I can take photos of birds farther away than I could before
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
I'm hopefully optimistic
I am very happy with the Polaroid and reccomend it highly to folks who don't take themselves too seriously
Most digital cameras for years do not include one as the options are huge and each person has their own needs on how much storage they need (and they're cheap)
I did extensive research before buying - I had never had anything but a Canon in the point-and-shoot category before
Ah, my little camera
It has a lengthy instruction book and will take time to master its various intricacies
Zoom pictures up on stage came out clear and bright
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
Love it
But can't seem to pick it up without pushing one of them silly bottoms
Obviously, if you're a serious photographer, this is not the camera for you, but for me, it's great
The image is perfectly fine for travel and family
Using it on full auto, snapping pictures of kids
The older models were like this
Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
Love the 34x zoom, was like I was standing right next to my subject from across the auditiorium
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
the canon g3 .
The flash is a little overpowering so thought I'd put a screen on it
It could use a vari-angle lens, but that's about my only suggestion at this point
again intuitive
I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price
the big Zoom with image stabilization is a dream come true
Great Superzoom
A Great Camera
I think the Panasonic FZ150/FZ200 has the best image quality for the bridge cameras but there is not a huge difference
This is a great camera
Handing has greatly improved on the T5 over the T3
Image quality is very good
The camera comes with a link for some application that you can import/view your images with, but I don't want unneeded software taking up space
I can get it to reclose by taking the battery out and in, saying voodoo and sometimes, out of desperation, pushing the lens physically
I only have one minor complaint
It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera
I also like the fact it has a HDMI port
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
After using a Coolpix L110 for work I liked the ergonomics so I purchased the L830 for my personal use
I do like the tilting view screen, though, which is something I've never seen before
My biggest problem with the camera is that I can't find a camera pouch to suit it
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
All the controls are well placed
This camera is extremely user-friendly, the battery life is great, and the photo quality, pretty darn good
So listen to all these other reviewers who actually know something about cameras, but as a complete idiot when it comes to this stuff, this camera is great
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
you're not going to find a better camera for this price
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
I was impressed with the functionality of the camera
I saw some reviews where this camera did not need a flash at all in dark environments
Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
Now this is a camera
And I was not using a tripod or anything else
Bulky & poor quality prints
This camera is really sturdy and well made
My wife likes the point and shoot without thinking part and I feel it has enough shooting modes and settings that I can take professional quality pictures
I got the "Battery Exhausted" message with the batteries it came with so in my excitement, I ran to Target to buy 2 packs of Energizer Lithium batteries, a case and a memory card
The zoom is amazing
While reviewing the camera prior to purchase, I noted other people mentioned the placement of the flash
It clearly picks up all of the tick tick sounds of the the lens as it focuses
To start off I wish I was able to give it 4
Knowledge of a camera's PASM settings will help a great deal here as you can really break through the surface features if this camera and get a lot out of it
Great Camera For the Money
Caught a gregarious hummingbird in flight this week
Except, of course, if you do not choose the perfect thing to photograph
With this camera it is much different, you hit the button once and it shoots 5 incredibly fast frames, then the whole camera locks itself up for 30seconds or so while it tries to process those images
I'm happy and I'd get it again
Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
I could go on but suffice to say, I was very unhappy
This is the best camera I have ever owned
It is light, 16 mp and the zoom is fantastic
Thank you, Missby
The main operating features are very intuitive
I bought this camera just in time for my birthday bash and, overall, it increased the night's fun by the 2nd power
THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
without a Leica lens, I'm sorry
First Rule in a Gun Fight, Have One
I would not recommend this product to ANYONE
If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
2) Battery life not so good when printing multiples
Good Photo Quality
I love how easily I can switch from stills to movie mode
Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise
Color is very good
Flying bird photos just did not work well at all
I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
CONCLUSIONSThe Lumix DMC-FZ70 is a surprisingly good value
Wish it had the adjustable viewer screen but I knew that before I purchased it
Bought the printer at the same time, but having difficulty finding a compatible cord for my Android phone or computer, so have not clue if it works yet
Good items
It is rather very difficult to remain steady and prevent shaking as the shake of your hand also multiplies 70 times
Stored in a padded case.
With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
Great pictures and easy to use
The wi-fi and app are lame and all but useless
WORST CAMERA EVER
I'm not a professional photographer, nor do I spend hours on my computer editing photos & video
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort
For my company I was the designated photographer for one of our events and they wanted me to use this particular one so that customers can also get a copy
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
The flip out adjustable screen makes it easy to keep steady for zoom shots
This camera was purchased  for my  daughter for  fourteenth  birthday
Of course, a tripod is great if you can use one along with the timer (since there is no remote release)
seriously ! i love it !
The pictures come out a bit fuzzy and the focus is how steady your hands are
Same for high over head pics
These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations
Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
Interchangeable lens can be a game-changer for someone interested in raising their photographic capabilities and the NEX mount lens catalog is fairly large
Two problems
It has a great zoom,has the latest Digic 6 Image Processor,shoots awesome video,and is made in Japan
She loves it - compact, clear pictures, very convenient, easy to store in pocket or purse
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
I'll start with the strengths
this camera has a major design flaw .
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
Well, as the title suggests, so far so good
Other reviews suggest thie Nikon Coolpix L830 suffers in build quality well that bug must have been fixed
I love how the pictures look :D and its so thing and light to carry around :) Im happy with my purchased
I can't say enough about this camera
Happy wife,happy life
To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography
I have used the Nikon S8100 for 3 months
The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
The LCD screen is tough to use for manual focus and you cannot see anything sharply through the QVGA Tru-Finder - viewfinder at all, no matter how you adjust the dial
]and the scratched lens pictures, many of which were still OK, are at [
The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
If you buy this from a reputable brick and mortar camera dealer, they might actually let you immediately trade in the 18-55 and put it towards a nicer lens
I looked into getting it repaired in China but the prices approached those of a new  camera and the expert shops said they couldn't get the part since it was made for the American market
something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING
Although I am primarily a still photographer, I have tried the video on several occasions and find that works well also
Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality
The only fuzzy images I have gotten were from testing the continuous shooting mode, and once I learned how to use the mode correctly I got great images with it
Good, but not as great as competitors
I've never been so amused as I have been while trying to find things to record in slow-mo
the battery charger is almost half size of the camera
I have had the camera just over the 30 day guarantee with Amazon and the lens stopped functioning
review by Larry Ponziani
I ultimately returned it
I got a lens error and the lens would not retract
- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing
The pictures it takes are beautiful
We highly recommend it
If you like using your phone to take instagrams your going love this camera
Currently it seems to be available at some pretty attractive pricing, which would seem to support my impression that it doesn't have a very well defined target audience
I knew we would not be close so the high power zoom is what made me choose this model
First, let me say that I am not terribly techy
This camera does the trick at portability and takes great pictures for a hand-held pocket sized camera
I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
Bummer
Bought this camera for many reasons and so far it's great
PICTURE STABILIZED VERY WELL
This camera is currently offered at a deeply discounted price (so if you if are considering it and see it for less than $300
It had more uses than I expected
I read thru the handbook just to get the basics and it is so easy to use
2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
So far, so good
We tried to shoot various live action sports with it and it does its 5 shots in the first second or so of pushing the button, then we are stuck again for another minute, at which point if we didn't get the shot in the first 5 shots, your screwed
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
so I can charge a battery without it being in the camera, which seems to be an issue with some users
You can get great deals on this camera since the 9100 came out which is basically the same camera with more zoom
What I gained in one area I lost in another between my fz50 and  fz70
Great camera
, so I purchased one anyway even with all the bad luck others have had with this camera
You can blow up your pictures on the screen much larger
By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream "manipulation" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening
The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus
easy to upload and print photos
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
great gift
Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used
When I called in I was told to take the batteries and sd card out and replace them
It is a digital point and shoot that prints but has some limitations
If the photos weren't so great, I would have seriously thought about returning it
Very versatile  with the super zoom
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
Which is a result of the CMOS sensor it has which is also why it is good in low light conditions
I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant
I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
The Nikon Coolpix S8000 we have is a bit limited for that use
We will take it to local camera shop for repairs
This is also the reason that I haven't explored all the features of the camera
Some of the downsides are things that
Excellent quality
Easy to set up and use
Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
Did I mention the pictures in a dimly-lit room come out blurry?  I had to return it
I have been an amateur photographer for 35 or so years
My son, as a surprise gift, bought my wife and myself tickets aboard a tour ship that went out into the SF harbor to watch the America's Cup
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
I am so looking forward to taking more pictures with this great camera
Soooo tired was I of the washed out deer-in-the-headlights effect of the Canon - finally, I take a picture of my dog, and it looks like my dog, you know? It seems a small thing, but hard to find at this price
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
Bottom line, the pictures out of this camera are very good
) The touch screen makes manual settings a breeze
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
I was surprised at the clarity of the long range shots but the true test will come when shooting action sports
recurring problem with battery
shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens
Do you hear me Sony
This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors
it 's no problem for me personally .
I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice
The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away
Perfect for carrying into the field
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
Lovely camera, I love it, 5 out of 5
Come on -- please --somebody build a high quality small format for the days the SLR can't go
It's a great size and it prints perfect Polaroid pictures
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens with an Optical Image Stabilization, which spans an incredible 25-750mm equivalent range in a pocket-sized body, is a significant improvement over the SX280's 20x range
Lens Error Strikes Again
The digital zoom is crap.
In my opinion, this product is not worth any price
The zoom is seamless and it focuses faster and clearer throughout the entire range than many SLR lenses I've used
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
I also had a hard time getting the flash to work to fill in backlighting, etc
I have not yet figured out how to set aperture in manual mode so if anyone knows please comment
Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks
And the fact that this camera allows you to control these features and so many more manually means you can make great photographs
I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
But a good camera for the price
The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
I was looking for a camera with a great quality in the pictures and videos, pretty color and a camera that I could put in my purse
Although not as small as the cameras he is used to, it fits nicely in a pocket
No blow outs of over-exposing
This is a great camera for the nostalgic types out there that like the esthetics of the vintage feel of the modern spin on the old Polaroid cameras
I love taking photos
To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
Not much of a learning curve at all for me, because I had a different Coolpix prior to this so it's similar
The lens wouldn't retract and the power stayed on with a "Lens Error" message on the screen
Low light is still a bit of a problem
My wife and I each have carried our own 300HS for about two years
great very wide and long angle telephoto lens
it's a great camera
With the camera that is
I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those
I think I'd do more research on the SDHC Cards before I buy one
Fast to set up
The images are a little better, the camera is smaller, cheaper and a 20x zoom is still more than most people will ever need
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
This camera that takes high resolution pictures, vivid colors, is reasonably priced
but this isn't what your interested in
if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
Great for scrap-booking
This camera at its low price is a lot of bang for the buck
good
The pictures certainly told a more vivid story
How does one know camera leaks oil?  The rotten scent emitted from oil in the chamber produces unique stinky scent, which is undeniably Nikon
2 thumbs up
The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
Not able to sit close
Incredible value
The camera overall is great in the fact you don't need different zoom lenses and it works much like the small camera versions only with a little more bells and whistles
The manual is excellent.
This camera has new technology for its "night portrait" mode
This camera is state of the art  "overall" , in terms of price, versatility & quality
End of story.
The only thing that truly disappoints me is that it does not automatically shut its self off
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
and at this price who can resist?
Five Stars
(And it is so much lighter than my digital SLR
Practice with settings and feel before you &#34;need&#34; it
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
Random errors
Excellent Bridge Camera for Amateurs and "Semi-Pros"
Download it fast to your computer
Middle price and use bridge type camera
just point and shoot
The LCD is crisp and clear but is mounted flush
at various events and be able to print them right then & there without any editing
Since like most people I got the camera for the still images this is a minor annoyance but still enough to keep it from being perfect
The 10x zoom is very good although I would like to have seen from a 12 to 15, but then the picture quality may have suffered
Like you need a separate bag just to carry this (exaggerating a bit)
Indoor movement (gym situations) with zoom is difficult to achieve
The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
But really no complaints for the price I paid($279)
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
It was also very reasonably priced
But if your main concern is still images, the S8100 is unparalleled
cool nikon
Nikon coolpix
Feels good
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
Pictures with flash are especially poor
The a3000 (also a5000) are probably just what the serious but cheap amateur needs - a second body
second one i bought
It is amazingly stable and sharp with little noise in side, and simply fantastic outside
Chunky enough to fit in your hands, not small enough and fragile to slip between small cracks and break
This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
I have taken very good care of this camera
I was also looking for a camera to take non-flash pictures at events such as communions and dance recitals
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics
On the other hand, when trying to take a still of the sunset
Low light performance was particularly dissapointing, and white balance was very eratic
My friend enjoys the shake reduction which saves her quite a few pictures
Great camera for the price
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
it fits perfectly
This is really not enough for me
I was not disappointed
Upon first attempt to import my photos, it failed to install the drivers crucial to allowing ease of access to the camera's files
Every time I review the pictures from this great little camera, I am always amazed at how good this inexpensive point and shoot is
So far the indoor shots I took along with some outdoor ones are crisp, clear, and the 60 zoom is about as far as you can go without losing photo quality
In my opinion some options, like scenes or light setup, should be acessed with the external bottom, without the obligation to go to Menu
]  Also helps to learn more on how to take pictures so you will not blame the camera for your failures
More importantly, the camera suits my needs perfectly, takes great pictures
Great pictures just forget the Wi Fi
Autofocus performance is pretty good although it's essentially the same AF system as before
what task do they perform ?
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
You see I never want to be caught without batteriesif ever I am in the right place at the right time with my camera at the ready
Perhaps I just need to go online and find more detailed descriptions
I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release
We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality
5fps) and doesn't stop until you release the button
UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots
When It Works, it's great
Be sure to spend some time with the instructions
Accessories are also available
I also use the memory card to print out photos taken with my Cannon
it is made of plastic .
As to the dreaded lens error message, you must get into the habit of removing the lens cover before turning the camera on
s8100
The FZ70 focuses quickly and well and renders tones smoothly
The Sony A3000 is an interesting animal; although it looks like a DSLR, it's a mirrorless camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you could think of it as a low-cost version of a NEX-5R fitted with its EVF option
The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing
I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
By far the Nikon Coolpix S8100 is the best compact point and shoot I have ever used
The zoom is incredible, crisp clear images
The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
My husband who has never been a picture taker even started taking the camera from me
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
Something I wouldnt have to make an insurance claim on if it were lost or stolen
I love this camera it is what I expected  other cameras you get it is never what you expect that you get
Great Camera
What they don't tell you is that the camera uses some type of proprietary RAW2 format
First, i realized that your finger gets in the way when you hold the camera, so your flash wont pop up
The zoom lens was excellent in daylight, even when hand held
I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
There are other, cheaper Polaroid cameras that print better pictures on actual film and are much more sturdy
Excellent camera
It then combines the two shots giving a true to life image of the the person and background
The 34x Zoom works great, and is very to  operate
This camera was supposed to replace my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 10 mp with an 18X optical zoom which has been a great camera
I have taken handheld shots of the moon with decent results
Great Value
Sharper pictures.
Zoom works really well, better than expected
Burst mode is fast but inside I did get a little blur between images, and it was not because of very fast action, but more when someone was moving their arm/hand
Designing the pop up flash on the left side of the camera you're the user tends to hold the camera, does not quite make sense to me; however, this was not a deal breaker to purchasing this camera
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
Great Point and Shoot
Not clear and crisp
The photos print with a green/blue hue
I just don't put my finger there - there's no particular reason to do so
This is a great product for the money, I needed an upgrade from my compact camera and this is pretty, lightweight and takes great pics
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
Overall I liked it and wished that it would have worked out
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
Perfect pic
That is why the instructions tell you to PUT THE STRAP ON YOUR CAMERA
The change to a new box of film did not resolve the issue
DMC-FZ70 is definitely a good buy for the price
I was going to buy a Nikon s820
issue I should have known about:- The screen is amazing but I was so enamored with it that I didn't realize there was no viewfinder
The best mirrorless camera I've used to-date
This is especially evident when zoomed to it fullest reach in anything other than bright daylight
Really bought this model because I wanted the 10x zoom feature
My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
Uses a rechargeable battery with a tiny life :(
Big thing is, this is a lot of camera for $300 bucks or so, and that 20mm wide end is pretty rare and a nice plus on top of that long zoom
2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
The challenge has always been low light and indoors
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
personally i dont know why anyone would use this
Was looking for a small camera with a great zoom and this is it
This camera has similar or even better quality than the entry level DSLR, but definitely less solid than mid-range or full frame ones (Nikon D90, Canon 7D, 5D Mark
They were never great but
Downloads easily to iMac
This camera is a must-have for long-distance zoom power, ease of use, and quality of pictures
;  A few firmware fixes will make this camera shine
Easy to use, great features - I recommend this camera for telephoto work without extra lenses
I don't know why the nav keys can both spin and be pressed
I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point
The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
And another thing about stealth:10) This is a noisy camera, and there is no option to lower the volume of the beeping or turn it off
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
The Microsoft SURFACE tablet and this Polaroid camera
Taking the battery out as to try reset it didn't work
This camera is highly recommended
Hopefully they fix that with updated firmware
Love it
Great for the money - close ups with flash it too much some times
60x optical zoom is impressive and very sharp, but what is even most impressive is the digital zoom
I Was wrong.
Colors are good and images are SHARP
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
It takes great pictures and I love the 30x optical zoom
If you want manual controls look elsewhere
Good color & contrast, even with piles of snow
I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
I also do notlike the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad
The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses
Don't zoom to the full length and don't use C-AF
The finish feels like it is rubberized or something
Well worth the money
This is very cumbersome
I feel so  PROFESSIONAL when that whopping zoom goes out
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
I know this is long-winded, but please bear with me
Great instant print/digital camera hybrid
The quality and build of the camera is okay at best
It does however tell you when you should pop the flash up
Secondly is the amazing ability to take great low light pictures
Also zooming and focusing sounds can be heard very loudly in any shot video
Before this purchase, I was a sony fan, but I am a fan no longer
The camera fits into a standard camera case
It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
I've only dropped this digital camera once within the year & half I had it & it is still working perfectly like it did day one plus no dings or scratches either
Decent camera but I returned it
There is also to many settings and it is difficult to figure out the best one, if I want to try different settings, the subject has moved or the light is different by the time I scroll to the next one, that said, I do like everything so far and will continue to experiment with all the settings
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
Very good contrast
I wanted a new camera, but I didn't want to spend too much money on it
At first it looks and feels a bit like the first round of digital point and shoot cameras
The camera is big, almost the size of DSLR
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
The Samsung NX2000 that has bigger sensor, was much more accurate, and the pictures, were much better, no blurry photos
&#34;  The photos, although exactly as described, are really, really small
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
Not a ground-breaking product, but solid and dependable nonetheless
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
very glad of purchase after much review about features and price
I highly recommending getting at least one on the Vivitars as a spare if you're planning to be away from your charger with this camera for any length of time
This one of the greatest camera that I have seen for the money
In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
Just tilt screen up to you and click
First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery
There's much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom, quick and accurate focus, true HD video, relatively good build quality
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
I have been a fan of the Panasonic Lumix Cameras for years
Right on target
I wanted to be able to easily take pictures of items and upload them online
The quailty of the printed picture is not decent at all
Taking pictures of objects at a distance is no problem for this camera
The consumer wins big time on the A3000
Amazing camera and I've only scratched the surface of what it can do
I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000
I set my Polaroid Z2300 at 8MP and the pictures come out nice, very little gets cropped in the printing process
Great performance in exteriors and landscapes
The camera works as expected and the video and photos taken are really great
Seemed like a great deal
All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
The big attraction for me with the FZ70 was the extra zoom but if I can get the same IQ cropping my FZ150 shots that cancels out the main advantage of the FZ70 for me
One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24" long
I'm sure others will be perfectly happy with it but it's not the camera for me
Bought this for my wife and the 60X zoom is fantastic
However, it has a few minor downsides which are minor, but regular annoyances
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
It is very plasitc-y and feels as if it will break easily
I suppose this camera works well for some, but I can't offer any more than a tepid recommendation that it does work
The bad:Viewfinder is smallLCD is not that sharp and does not swivel (I use it to compose not review my pics, so does not affect me
I am an experienced photographer and normally use a full-size DSLR (D300s, D200, etc
What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
I especially love the fact that it is mirrorless and weighs less than a traditional dslr, this has no effect on the picture quality however
I will say that if you don't care about the high powered zoom and burst shooting, this may be a good camera for you, but if those features are important keep looking
doesnt show pic right when printed
Would've if the screen had swivel/tilt, but this was not a surprise to me
It takes great pictures in low light areas and has a stabilization mobilizer
Every single thing it does is a mini miracle
More than I expected for a SLR cheap camera
It is light
The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR
For the price, could have included an SD card and instruction manual
Battery life is too short and the battery has to be in the camera for it to recharge
So why would you choose the T5 over the SL1? It really all comes down to the handling
i took this on a cruise and caught pic's of flying fish between the waves
We were able to take some great shots both near and far
It takes fantastic indoor pics
LOVE MY NIKON
The image stabilization system is EXCELLENT
I got the red camera and I saw finger prints mine of course, but that does not bother me
and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool
Canon does a decent job balancing out noise, noise reduction, and detail retention in the JPEGS as you go up the ISO scale
When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended
Excellent size, light and high quality photographyBut the price is not suitableI love it for ever and ever
I took one to China with me in 2010 for a short Thanksgiving trip
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
easy to/ use
This camera takes EXCELLENT photos for a point and shoot
I have owned two of these, in black and chrome/platinum colors
i do n't think i was asking too much .
Although I've had this camera since November, I had not been able to use it
In low-light indoor situations, I needed a steady hand to avoid motion blur
a card with more memory is a must .
It is very small and portable, you can bring this camera anywhere you go
Battery life remains decent but it's somewhat shorter than the T3
I couldn't even tell it was a real estate sign from where I stood, but the photo I took is extremely sharp and clear
so far so good
Looking at pictures taken with a Canon T3, and this, there is no comparison
Big 3
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
I'm keeping it since it serves the purpose and I figured if I really want a good quality print, I can just print it from the store
Incredible zoom which allowed me to capture poster-worthy images of the craters on this recent Supermoon, even w/o the benefit of a tripod
I narrowed the choices between the following; Olympus VR2, Sony''', Samsung""", Nikon S8100, Cannon'''
Not As good as my FZ200
I have this T5 but it stays in bag when doing shots
Thank you
reason for two ?
Photos are superb
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
I FOUND IT
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
Well wait no more!
I have owned quite a few digital cameras over the last ten years
bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic
You need to invest in lenses which can be very costly, add to that having to carry around extra gear and swapping lenses on the fly
I never changed batteries for the whole week in Arizona, and then added another couple of days of battery life in France, and those were with the batteries that came with the camera
The last camera I had was left in an airport in Portugal and not recovered
We have had it only a few weeks and love it
Good value
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more
In auto mode, the image quality is great even though it is apparently capped off at Fine (the camera can take pictures with Superfine quality in other modes)
WHY?  Why why why do they do this?  I suppose it's to be able to have a USB charger but for me this is really annoying
Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
No Wi-Fi
and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED
People keep knocking this camera for it's lower res LCD and viewfinder and other minor issues
For this price point you can't beat this camera
It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it
My daughter requested this product last year for x mas but unfortunately I could not find it
The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu
I've taken a ton of video with this camera, and it is always impressive
Positives:
The results are exceptional, the videos are super clear and the audio is great
Post dawn, full light shots of surfers looked like Pointilization art
I have put back in the camera level tested again but it looks like I will be buying a new card
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
By far, this is the best camera I have
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
The focal point looks okay but anyone around it who is even moving ever so slightly, will appear blurry
I've never seem a camera shoot so well in Auto
It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet
Being disabled I do not have the luxury of being able to pop round the the Ye Olde Photo Shoppe for a bracing battery refill
One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW
8 on the 50mm lens and being able to shoot 1080p video is really incredible
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
Five Stars
Print outs do not come out clear
It takes excellent point & shoot pictures just using all the defaults (it seems to be smarter than I am)
It's really easy to use, which is a good thing
Awesome photos, a couple of reservations
Saves carring a lot of gear
I can find it by feel now
Very intuitive, great functionality and better yet great quality pictures
I am not a good photographer
I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus
I received my Nikon quickly, well packaged and exactly as advertised
I am excited to give it as a Christmas gift and capture some memories with it
- The noise level in dark conditions is just NOT acceptable
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
The pictures were very comparable to my Nikon Coolpix 500
And the quality of the pictures printed from it are not very good
I have experienced with several DSLRs from Canon, Nikon and Pentax
It is so easy to use, my wife doesn't have to even think about what to do
The zoom on this is really good, even from the 20 yd line I was able to snap close up pics of the colts on the opposite end of the field
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
They absolutely love it
The image quality is just ok as a point and shoot and the real fun of the camera is the printer
I bought this camera for my mother
the photos looks very natural
The photos are clear and beautiful and the different options are great
I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys
The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a viewfinder, which I don't remember seeing in the description at all
I like the Powerful 30x Optical Zoom in this camera
Ive read complaints about size but you get what you get for what your getting
as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
Fantastic so far
Have not tried video
60x optical zoom
However, I was unhappy with pictures taken in low-light
It seems wrong that at this point, I prefer my older/lighter Panasonic bridge camera or my new compact waterproof camera to this one
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
Highly recommend this camera
That's something I always look for when buying a new camera
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
Took this camera with me on a safari trip to Africa and I was thrilled with my pictures
The flash is bright and good at not blowing out images
I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
I quite like the product
Images in low light are very difficult to accomplish and the flash doesn't help with the results (muddy, grainy prints
I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection
The come out with a blue-green hue that almost resembles that "vintage" look, but actually comes off as terrible quality from a sub-par and over-priced product from what used to be the most trusted name in instant cameras
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
It is easy to use, great features, and compact so you can still tote it around everywhere you go
No optical view finder; pictures must be framed via LCD monitor, which is extremely difficult in daylight with sun behind you
LOVE IT
But this is not much of a factor unless really zoomed
start up is so quick Ã±
The video focus will hunt a TINY bit when zooming, but, this camera WILL zoom during video, unlike others
The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
Its perfect for its size and may I add INSTANT PRINTING? Thats right
i give it 10 stars !
it has dozens of modes to shoot under
I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
stop deliberating and select it
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
You have many shooting options which is great
Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing
its definitely not the best I've experienced
The camera only shoots jpg or Raw+Jpg , you cannot shot just RAW
"  So, I am thinking that I will spread the word about our $180 worthless piece of junk that really didn't take good pictures anyway
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
What really impressed me was the low light performance which is no doubt due the larger ccd
Like it
8 allows you to shoot at faster shutter speeds in low light situations because the circle in the lens allows more light to pass through because of the lower aperture
I wanted to be able to take great pictures of my family and friends, etc
In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos
I am getting some very nice shots at about half the zoom length, though
I did buy it before all the cameras went on sale for Christmas, and i was bummed i didnt wait
Better than I thought
Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]
I used this camera on my vacation to Costa Rica
About one in ten photos was acceptable, a problem compounded by the fact this was hard to determine until the photos were downloaded and viewed on the computer
However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
Not chintzy at all
It's also pretty heavy at 11 ounces with battery and printing paper
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
Thanks
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
I bought this camera to use when I need a wide to tele travel camera
First of all I am not a professional photographer graduated from a university, but know a little more than basic concepts
Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting
I also used it for night portraits and they turned out fine, too
The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
The price was very good
The picture quality is the best I have seen in any camera I have ever used
So, over all, best compact camera I've seen
Fantastic fun easy to use camera that brings fun to any event
The power button on top can easily be accidentally toggled as well
This item had sold out, but then again it was about 2 weeks before the holiday
I purchased this camera to take with me on a trip to Africa
It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
2) I did not realize soon enough that this camera does not have the option to take black/white pictures or much less sepia, or any other tones
The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested
This is a bit thicker than the other digital cameras, but we knew that going in
Its the best camera for the money and it takes beautiful pictures
They give great photo quality, it has everything you would need for a great photo
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
It is bulky, but it is a camera, and certainly not as bad as a DSLR plus lenses, etc
I've posted several photos at this Amazon camera link for people to view that demonstrate the features most important to me
Its two items; a camera and printer compressed into one
The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7
Until I get the update to solve this, I will be shooting RAW and JPEG
Pretty cool camera although the quality of photos are pretty messy
The zoom was great, the pictures sharp and the price, very good
It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing
the grain was terrible .
Viewfinder image very crisp
We on a cruise and this took great picture way our there
A nice add on in the print menu
I bought this for work because I need to occasionally take pictures or video of things to upload to social media sites
Also, compared to the FZ200, iZoom performs much better, fewer artifacts, very usable pics
Better than their previous version, I like the ease it takes to take pictures and how the auto focus works, you will too, takes great pictures
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
Even at max zoom, the auto focus can compensate for my hands, the pictures are very clear and crisp, and it does pretty decent video too
When in manual focus mode, the viewfinder digitally zooms in to make it easier to find focus
Does not come with an SD card, so you'll need to purchase one
So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back
I knew that the scenery there would be more than I imagined
Unit arrived overnight which was nice
Four Stars
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
The flash is very weak.
Nifty camera with inherent problems
I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
(BTW - Vivatar makes cheap higher capacity batteries for this camera I later discovered) Overall, this camera is large for a pocket camera and fairly heavy but it is packed with features and a great zoom that honestly is at the limit of being functional at full zoom (30x max zoom requires bracing your arms to stay on target)
A tilt screenwould help,but this is a common problem
Spend the money and get a DSLR with a good lens or two
I enjoy all the options and the zoom is spectacular
I can share images and video easily to my phone
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
But once you start printing straight off of the camera it is such a rush you're actually amazed it is so compact
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
Overall I think ii is a fine camera
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
What a surprise
It is also a little easier to focus at the farthest end of the zoom than I thought it would be
Once in a while I'll get a winner but more often than not, they look washed out
DMC-FZ70 camera
You get down to 20mm, btw, which is wide enough to capture a large family reunion photo, and in the next shot you can fill the frame with one persons eye
Like it better than the comparable Cool Pix
Great Little Camera
Hope the zoom is good
I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
Not only did the image stabilization take care of my tremors, it also took care of the rolling of the tour ship
The only good thing about the flash is that it cycles very quickly
It doesn't help that the couple of online &#34;reviews&#34; of this camera say that it DOES have an orientation sensor, nor does it help that Sony's website doesn't say anything about it at all
I think this camera offers unparalleled value in its category
)Of course I love the 1080 video shooting, but it eats up alot of memory, so you will need a SDHC card or two
I was very pleased with the images I got
But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp
I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319
Great camera for the price
And it's okay as viewfinders go
Once I got it, everything went great for the remainder of the trip
Why Nikon didn't include a stand a lone charger with this camera is beyond me
Recognizing the features this does not seem to be a great problem
5 stars
Buy one & go out and take some amazing photos
Better image quality and fully fix the noise from SX260 video
The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
Other than that, I'm very happy with it
Same with the gutters on a neighbor's house, and the dashboard of a small airplane
The aggregated image was spectacular
The picture and sound are so much better
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
I haven't noticed any noise and have taken about 20 hours of video
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
Big Zoom but Poor Image Quality UPDATED
bigger image sensor3
Great for starters
My Mom is very careful of her things, and even with her being cautious of the camera, After 3 weeks, the shutter broke
The colors are great and the zoom is wonderful
(always keep an extra set
it's not my first choice in cameras,
I do nature photography
photos had some artifacts and noise .
Like that I can replace batteries immediately and don't have to wait and charge them
This is a great camera
The zoom is also fantastic - image stabilization works well with this, unlike the Lumix, supposedly the best rated in this category, but in my try-out, irregular at best
It could be a GREAT camera with the following: variable speed zoom, manual aperatue and manual shutter speed, and a viewfinder for those sunny days
The camera stopped focusing after 1 week
Right between the 35mm and the pocket cameras
The mode dial is well thought out; the auto scene select mode is dynamite
The tilt screen is great, it allows this senior to get shots that would be difficult otherwise
The flash comes up automatically but needs to be manually pressed down to be closed
Best camera in it's price range
This camera is easy to use
3 OSS Lens for $427
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
She took a picture  of a deer in the woods
1 MP and I can say less than $80 for this 20
I compared it to mirror less Samsung NX2000with 20-50mm and 50-200mm lenses, and DSLR camera 18-200mm, looking for reasonable quality photos
There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
I kid you not, I was able to get framable, clear, up close shots of a bald eagle that was sitting in a tree about a quarter mile away
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability
It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
This camera is great for a novice like myself
I have gone through over 10 different point and shoot cameras over the past 13 years
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
No more lenses to change
go get it .
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
Low light photos look really good so far, but I need to experiment more
Flash coverage was good for portrait situations
3 sensor
I got this for my road trip, and it's fabulouuuusss
And I like not having my camera precariously perched on a hotel window sill whilst charging
I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
Nice
DO NOT expect some DSLR or mirrorless cameras' image quality
Recylce time for most modes is a bit slow, but if you leave your camera on continuous mode, you can get that second shot off almost instantly, provided you don't need the flash
So, I researched several cameras and this had the price that I needed on my budget but also have nearly as much total zoom as those competing cameras had at twice the price
Went to Grapefruit League spring training games - bright Florida sunlight
To date, I have been unable to use the Wi-Fi feature to download to Mac computers and into iPhoto
Other complaints in reviews have to do with the location of the flash - not a problem for me
1, It repeatedly report &#34;lens error&#34; and now died
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
So far I love the quality of the pictures
When it worked, I loved the S8100
I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing
I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
My fiancee and I were very happy about buying this camera after doing our research
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
As with my other Lumix cameras, I never use a tripod, and the stability feature of this camera is as good as the previous models
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
Focus is fast and accurate
LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
but remember you need the right amount of light to get the Best quality out of the Pictures and Video
Easy to use
going back to canon
However the size camera alone makes it very much an outlier and for travelers of those who appreciate a more svelte form factor there are better options
I love them
A thrill to own
] An example of it at its best is the Oregon Coast pictures at [
You get the same 18-55 IS II lens that came with the T3
Awesome zoom
Tried the "Trouble Shooting" suggestions
They turn out blurry
You can have it up, running and zoomed in all the way in just about a second
The quality and ease are simply amazing
Got the dreaded "Lens Error" message and it would not work
Doesn't work well in low light even with the flash
Also some great bird shots using mid tele in overcast situation - still great photos
Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference
Good for a novice photographer
thanks for nothing , amazon !
I mention the settings I have changed because it seems like people complaining about fuzzy images simply do not know how to use even a basic point and shoot camera
Great Camera
It's not a deal breaker and it's not that bad, but just be aware that you can hear the zoom
Secondly, I had a hard time easily finding some of the settings that I desired
I love the movie feature too
SOLD
unfortunately we are no longer able to
I tested this camera on the auto mode and it has totally impressed me
I always end up placing my finger on top it
Never abused.
I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
NIKON COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera
I'm sending this back
so be sure to check it out I think the T3i is the camera to get at the present time
If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom
I have all kinda of cameras and lenses but when it comes down to it I don't want to carry them around
That camera is a horsew and buggy compared this one
I highly recommend it
And our prints had really bad streaks
Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
Unless you love lugging around a full sized DSLR, this camera will perform 90%+ of what you want while still fitting in a large pants pocket or purse with a simplified user interface and fast startup for quick shots
What a difference from the typical point and shoot models
WOW
I don't understand why an in stock item did not ship
Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video
Polaroid Bad Business Policy
I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
So far I have taken a few hundred photos an I am more than pleased with the results
Image quality is top notch for a point and shoot
I really like the camera, the zoom is great takes great pics
I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface
I love this camera
Took it on a trip to Oregon and using it much
Canon -- by far the best camera made at all levels
Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc
Great HD movies, great pictures even at the lower pixels
awesome
If you take a number of photos even in moderately quick succession, and then close the camera, you often have to wait several seconds, which is a bit annoying
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
(I posted some shots I took that day
Amazing quality and so easy to use
I do wish it had an articulating screen, remote shutter socket, larger buffer, but you can't have everything at this price
It is bigger, but a better camera and printer
So I will just be carrying one camera now
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
My last camera was a Canon power shot
And the pouch is a great way to protect and carry the camera andfilm film
Very wrong.
Fantastic Purchase
I had heard good things about Nikons and I made the switch when my wife lost our little Canon point and shoot
Tempermental camera
Owned for a few weeks now
Blurry, blurry, blurry
I did notice there doesn't seem to be an HDMI port, but honestly I never use those anyways on any of the cameras I do have one on
I was looking to replace my aging Kodak and decided on this camera after months of searching and reading online reviews
Really need an owners manual
com because was cheapper comparing with the other websites and you will receive a pretty cool case in leather for it
Love it
it uses ZINK system different polaroid
Being a mirrorless DSLR, this camera does not have an optical viewfinder, which has it's upsides
I t has the perfect size and all the functions for a family camera, and in a affordable price
They should INSIST in their literature that you must use their short list of 4 SD cards
Fabulous zoom
Love Nikon
It feels very solid
THROW THE CASE AWAY
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
Light to carry
Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like
ever
Takes good pictures - minor low light issues, but after 10 months the lens cover (plastic pieces slide over lens when closed, supposed to slide away when open), is no longer opening
software for editing a little &#34;lax&#34;, but over-all very good for home use
I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a very solid point and shoot camera
It doesn't give any info as to what the different scenes should be used for
basically everything about it
The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera
I am not a great or even good photographer, but part of my job involves taking photos and incorporating them into my journals
I'm about to resell mine and get a cute, cheap point and shoot
So fast that I found it a bit hard to get the zoom just right at first
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
The only thing I am not sure of is the selector/adjustor wheel if this mechanism proves to be reliable then I think we have another winner here
It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient, even when shooting video, since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera
Highly recommended.
It feels and looks very solid and well built
00 total
No memory card is provided
Unacceptable Reliability
I love this camera
I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji
It would be better have a slower FPS that sits and shoots 1 frame/second (like my old cannon p&s;) but a least you can hold it down for an entire sports sequence and hopefully get some of the action
My reservations-  Hate not having a viewfinder
I bought this camera because it was supposed to be fast and take good low light pictures
Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around
But I truly was blown away by this camera
Otherwise fantastic camera
the flash ruins most pics
This is such a vast improvement over that first one that it's hard for me not to be enthusiastic about it
The manual is excellent and well constructed
I also changed the picture resolutions to try, but I was still not happy with the results
One of the best buys around all things considered, especially for those who shoot wildlife
You really don't need a telescopic lens when you have this unit
I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
Very little shutter lag, comparable or better than other good digitals I've owned (Canon A710, 1100is)
It's very easy to use and takes great pictures
In the end, I only kept the camera for the weekend and decided that this particular camera just isn't for me
Opening the battery door is a real beast until you get the hang of it
The camera did not ship and most of the accessories already have
a little pricy for being such an outdated version of a camera
Of the dozen or so other digital cameras I've used over the years, this Lumix was able to access, load, and save the pictures to the internal memory faster than any other
The price is $... more.
Great camera, good price
Easy to Use
With a 2 year old, I want to capture as much as possible without having to worry about bulk and lenses
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
Granted, i am currently deployed in Afghanistan where dust is always a problem
Very fast and great zoom
5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings
I also got some out of focus pictures because I was fiddling around trying to use that focus button
Also, use of monitor increases rate of battery pack depletion
I love the ease of use and the light weight
It almost makes the video useless
I look for it in Amazon marketplace and the Nikon S8100 is it
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
Nikon L830 DOES NOT HAVE ANY ZOOM NOISE WHILE FILMING A VIDEO
Makes me feel like I know what I am doing
negatives ?
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
These are considered "budget" or beginner DSLR's but in actuality, they are packed with features and unless you are a pro, you won't need much more in a DSLR
If you want a bridge between a digital 35mm and the little point and shoot or cell phone cameras this Canon SX700 should be considered
I love this camera
I am very pleased with this purchase
Come on Nikon
But these positives don't even come close to outweighing the horrible quality of the printouts
How can something that cost almost 200$ have the quality of a 20$ camera? The pictures print blue
Auto settings work well
And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
This camera is great
I wanted a fast point-n-shoot camera
i didnt wait to experiment .
If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
I still have lots more testing to do in this area however
And the more I play with it, the better it gets
It's a tad pricey for what it is but, it certainly is a lot of fun
It fits comfortably in my hands, and it's easy to use
I love this camera
Excellent Product from SONY at an unbelievable Price
So far, my experiences have been super
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
This is a replacement from the P O S that was a Nikon
When it figures out the range the parentheses turns green
Fool proof.
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
It's also great for taking flashless pictures inside somewhere like an art gallery
I am not a professional, but this camera makes me look like one
This one is tops in my books
trips .
My first camera in this line was the FZ 28
I'm a non-auto pretty much manual kind a photographer and don't like all the special things this kind of camera does
does a great job at so little price
The continuous shooting mode is as fast as they describe, but the flaw is that it doesn't work like other cameras
I have had full size dslr and slr Nikons all my life
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
I give it 4 stars only because the GPS function is missing
It does operate in low light, produces pictures with great fidelity
I could not be more pleased
Battery Drain
I'm guessing they did this on purpose so people wouldn't realize what a battery hog this thing is
Neither of us cared for the necessity of charging the battery in the camera and preferred an immediately replaceable battery but it turns out most better quality cameras are of this species so we bought an extra batt to solve that issue
I can honestly say i am very satisfied with this purchase
Would recommend this camera
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance
The Quality is Good
The number one reason to get a camera like this is the full manual controls over such things as shutter speed and aperture
Tremendous camera with terrific price
I will update the review after a few weeks and my comfort level grows with the camera but for now I am in love
It's a wonderful concept in the sense that you can print whichever pictures you want without wasting film like other polaroids and save them
I was forever hitting the playback button with my thumb, because that is the natural way to grip this camera
At the upper end of the zoom range, the focus is a little soft
This camera takes great pictures, very simple to operate
Dropping your f-stop to 1
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
With the SX700, I am getting very good photos and video, it is always ready to shoot both close ups and distant object, no lens change necessary, and it is light weight and easy to carry
)  Really great stabilization
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
4) It is a battery eater
Easy to use, fun to explore the settings, takes amazing photos, and it was a GREAT price
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
If you shoot in dim lighting you may wish to consider something with a bigger sensor, faster maximum aperture and/or a hot shoe for an external flash
The pics come out beautiful but you may need to reshoot sometimes due to flash overexposure or blurriness in low light (pretty standard with these mega zoom compacts)
Now you can change change the mode dial into any mode
or a T mount adapter
This is a versitle camera and you can adjust the setting to take what ever kind of pictures you want
Great little camera
Way below expectation
It has tons of extra features for a p&s; and it the perfect companion to my D60
The only thing that really stands out about this camera is its size and price point - both of which aren't pros
This was annoying
Usually I wait for the reviews and buy then but the features on this looked good and besides, its Christmas
The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
This will help capture our memorable vacation forever
I do not regret my purchase
Also the image quality was very sub-par
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
So detailed as you review your work, I can even see how good my pictures are without having to use my laptop
Even when I kept the ISO from climbing above 200 and held the camera reasonably steady, low-light pics were usually fairly grainy and/or blurred somewhat due to motion
What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
Even at 120x, I see very little grain and surprisingly little chromatic distortion
I'm not a photographic expert so I don't know what to call it when the camera enhances photos but it does a great job
It's basic design and straight-forward operation make it a great choice for students or someone who wants something that can give them better image quality than their phone or point and shoot
I have had it less than a year though and the battery is shot
It's a really good choice
Image quality over the large zoom range is a huge plus for this product, even in low light conditions
Great so far
I love it, LOVE IT
Though the internal memory did allow me to take 22 pictures and a 15 second video before running out of space, so there's plenty of room to try it out before investing in a memory card
I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2
Newly acquired
It goes everywhere and after two years is showing a little external wear
1 MP, you can't find it anywhere else
The very wide angle end of the focal range is great for indoor social shots
This was my fourth Panasonic Lumix camera - I have stepped up from one of the first Bridge cameras that they offered, and I loved them
I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING
I'm not asking for metal material at this price but it could at least be made from just better plastic
Doing a lot of low-light work? The ISO range of the T5i is larger: T5 100 - 12,800 vs T5i 100 - 25,600The T5i has a 9 point cross-type Autofocus  vs only 1 in the T5The T5 has about 100 shots MORE of battery life than the T5i
Very easy to operate for someone with dexterity issues or large hands
I really have been really happy with the wind noise reduction when taking videos and the ability to stay in focus when zooming in video mode
Stabilization program very effective
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
WOW
It's a good camera for amatures
The features are more trouble to access on the menu,  but may get easier with time and use
I don't mind the fact that it doesn't have a view finder seeing as I haven't used one in many years
The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use
We have already tried the camera out, and it truly is an amazing camera with clear photos
I decided to go with Nikon as a last resort of ever finding a decent camera at a decent price which someone of decent intelligence could operate
Best of all, the instant camera prints are only 50 cents a piece
and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
I was a bit skeptical because the price of this camera was so low, so I went to walmart to try it out and fell in love
great colors , pictures and white balance .
I love this camera
It has many extras on it that I almost wished that I would have ordered one for my other son as well
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
The centre button is no longer customisable
Take a picture of a full moon with full zoom
One recommendation no matter which camera you buy,  get the fastest SDHC/XC card you can find
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
Disappointed
In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
(2) holding the camera still enough for low light photos at long telephoto settings was a problem
Perfect for kids sporting events
AF was fast enough for an outdoor event
downloads are a snap and quick .
Relatively lightweight, beautiful shutter response, and the test of all tests for images--at full resolution, pristinely clear quality (little noise in the right lighting)
The auto mode works in most cases
The have some great options that allow you to shoot 1mp at 120 fps, or 12mp at a decent rate
What I especially liked:-The picture quality in general-The 30X zoom has surprisingly low chromatic aberration
But I am still very pleased with the camera and give it a top rating
Love the simplicity, the 34x zoom, the easy picture modes and manual setttings, the video, the sound
This is an awesome camera for the money
point and shoot camera
Excellent Purchase/Excellent Seller
This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
We love this camera
Buy it and then let the fun begin
I'm new to this camera and new to super zoom cameras, but likewhat I've seen so far
Bottom line: Not worth it
If they worked these problems out, gave it 30 more minutes of life, and gave it an infrared or radio remote, this would be a great camera, sadly though, I can only recommend it as a great starting camera for kids, or as a high resolution backup camera with video capability
As far as the zoom lens, most of the zoom range was unattainable with handheld use
Great Camera
it is going digital but this product can't even provide basic standard quality of digital images
The L830 can use all three types
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
I can still continue video but am not sure how long I have
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
So much so, I generally use my point and shoot far more than my SLR (unless taking pictures of birds)
It takes great pictures and is simple to use
I like the feel of this little camera, sturdy not plastic
On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
It took great photographs
The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is
Does lots and has great zoom
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
this camera will stay with me for years !
That whole full HD video was not HD at all
FlyBoy Seal of Approval
Then we purchased an FZ150 and the detail is excellent
I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
Better on sale
I am done with Nikon products
$400 bucks for 3 months of use is sad
The zoom is great -- I took pictures of the moon during the blood moon eclipse without using a tripod and loved the pictures I got
This camera is truly an exceptional value
But the best I can give this camera is 3 stars
The instructions that come with it are very basic
Flash photos tend to have exceptionally poor color, relative to how well the camera does everything else
The Canon sx superzoom series of digital cameras have consistently delivered terrific image quality in good lighting in a pocket sized camera
As with any small camera, holding it without interfering with flash etc
Thus, the one star as there isn't a zero star rating
I've taken it to a couple parties where it does just fine snapping pictures and the ability to print on the spot and hand over the picture is a nice throwback to the old poloroid days
for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
Low light performance seems quite good
MSRP was $299, Sale was $269 and Got it from Walmart for $229, I think she quoted me the wrong price over the phone and had to get a manager override to give me the quoted $229
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account
Cons:Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control
I love this camera
If you are shooting a lot of low-light, you may also want the T5i
I am told by Nikon that cameras currently being manufactured will have the new updated firmware, but that those on the market now will need the fix
Perfect camera for the price
for more $$$ of course
I can't wait to take it off of "Auto" mode and try some of the other settings
Tech support is rather lackluster
The motor noise is hardly noticable
So happy with the low light pictures too
A promising camera that under-delivers
For normal viewing, the images look fine and should print fine
But compared to a regular digital camer this is very poor quality
The Rebel line of Canons has produced some incredible cameras such as the T3
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
It is small, lightweight and very easy to handle with one hand
But you can get fantastic, and often sharper photos if you experiment with one or more of the details you can change on this camera, and the way you set up the focus for a photo is one of the most important variables
This is a very nice camera
Rating the 8100
proven canon built quality and lens .
The Olympus had nice features (8x optical zoom, manual capabilities and threaded lens barrel)
LCD screen is beautiful and high resolution
Video quality is as good as I have seen for such a small device
For the features, this camera is hard to beat, the automatic scenes do what they are supposed to quick, and easy
all this cammera can do
It is a complete piece of s***
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
You can use built in differnt scenery mode or let camera decide it for you
Video is sharp although I have not used it extensively yet
I Expected a Lot
I had to go into my settings because digital zoom was disabled on my camera
WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet
You dont have the convenience of a &#34;pocket&#34; point and shoot, but the picture quality is a lot better than the Canon pocket camera I had
That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear
highly recommended .
In looking at the specs on the L830, it looked like just the right thing to replace the P100
I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
I printed out the online manual which yielded 204 pages
Side by side comparisons with lesser cameras bring out the start difference in color clarity and definition
DON'T BUY ONE
Excellent
The camera has no major quirks or malfunctions, it just works
I'm not asking for professional quality here, but it should at least be as good as my iPhone, if not better
Canon has a much better processor in it
Compact and light enough to cart around when space is on budget
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
The quality of the pictures are great
I was hoping it might be 75% as good but sadly it's more like 25% in our indoor photos
Overall gives good value for pric range
Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
Several features contributed to this
Except, it should cost about 100 dollars cheaper
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
I haven't tried video yet
This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing
So far, it is the most impressive camera I've owned
This camera comes with wifi transfer of photos, have not set it up yet so can't speak to that at this point
The unit is small, compact, light, with a great picture quality
Definitely weighs more than my ultracompact, but I knew that going into this class of camera
this was a pretty good buy
I would have given it 5 stars except for pictures taken of small children or animals
(maybe in a few years?)So, I wanted a camera that could deal with low light, shoot fast, start up fast, shoot again fast, and be around 200 bucks
It takes pictures that are worthy of being taken and printed
This is my 4th digital camera and it is by far the best I have ever used
After several hours of use, the flickering seemed to mostly go away, but not entirely
This may be a hassle for some people but since I choose what pictures to print and save, not so much of a dealbreaker, just wanted to point it out to others
There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration
If you're deciding to buy one of the instant print cameras I recommend you keep looking
Being in the military and deployed, this bothers me as I have to continually make a conscious effort to keep the screen from being damaged
A steady hand is required at all times or forget it
I returned it for a full refund due to be so disappointed
I only use the basic, camera-figures-out-everything setting
I'm using a 16GB Class 10 card
My Samsung S5 was used for all our panoramic shots
Works nice and takes video also
After twelve prints, I am not getting true colour
This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do
Great camera from Sony
and am optimistic that I won't be one that has to go that route
However, with the SX700 there is no choice, you must use the screen
Glad I made this purchase
What a joke
Most disappointed
This picture and video quality are superb
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
It didn't take long to learn the features and functions
It isnt that loud
This camera is extremely versatile and easy to lug around
PROS:1) The Polaroid Z2300 has the throwback design that ultimately made it more portable than the Fuji Instax cameras
Many shots looked like badly done art filters in Photoshop rather than photographs from a moderately expensive bridge camera
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
(2) Ease of use - it doesn't matter if you're used to another brand of pocket camera before: this one is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called "pixel peeper", don't get this camera
The dial is stiff and clicks into place (but doesn't lock into place)
It sticks out more now and is easy to turn
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
But overall it's fast and dependable
So the camera becomes unavailable during that time
The sharpness even at full zoom is great and the noise level isn't bad at all
The only way to see your movie in High definition is to burn it into a Blueray DVD (expensive option)
Twilight mode is slow when it has to take multiple shots and combine the pictures into one
BadLower light/indoor performance is poor
Another fault was when I tried to work with RAW on my MAC
Great correspondence, prompt service
Just ordered, and received it in 1 day
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
Rather than compare specifications, let me just say what I love about this camera
Expectations of the zoom were probably too high for a point and shoot
Great Camera
It even exposes the flash correctly
I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
I needed something less complicated than what I had before so this is amazing for me
A couple of times I was able to restart it and it would work but now it has died a second time
I have now been able to take videos of the sunset with out that "white light" line or I think it is called light sheer
Also the exposure looks fine on the screen but when seen on viewer/computer, it's a bit too dark
Other things:(a) contrary to the good impression many reviewers have of the Sony 18-55, I found the lens to severely lack in sharpness, especially at the borders;(b) the sensor is very nice, but a bit noisier than my 16mp Pentax K-30;(c) the camera comes with a small brochure, but you'll have to download the more comprehensive handbook from Sony's website;(d) no charger, either--you can charge the camera directly or buy a charger;(e) I found the menu fairly difficult to navigate
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
ugly to boot
I'm disappointed there aren't more settings (the point-and-shoot digital camera I bought back in 2006 seems to have more) or it's not intuitively obvious how to use them
Fun for what it is
Love love this camera
Also very impressed with some of the special easy to use special effects like the background blur as well as others
The manual could be better
Easy to use, great pictures
Photos have nice clarity
I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision
8 battery life is excellent .
COOLPIX L830
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
It's been over ten years since I got my last camera, my first digital one
Im not an experienced photographer but even on auto its amazing
Nice
Sure, it's cheap, but I've recently seen dslr's selling for $50-70 more (new)
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds
I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
I learned that I can use the 60 X manual focus but that I'm not restricted to that
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
Sometimes it is slow to focus in real dark scenes
I do not plan on using the video feature, other than perhaps on a rare occasion, as I bought it to carry around in inclement weather more than anything, rather than expose the D90 or the D300s to winters elements
However, I had a few others doing the photography with me didn't have a steady hand and even though that there's an anti shake it still didn't help them
Nikon COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera is the greatest camera ever
I have had 3 different cameras since the beginning of the digital camera age, and this one is by far the best
Then every time I connected my camera to my computer via the USB cable provided, it claims that the USB port is not a USB 2
Yes it has a flash and it uses it
The internal memory is descent with about 50 pictures worth of space
The bulky size to accommodate the 4 AA batteries and lack of a viewfinder (a common complaint for most LCD cameras) cost this other great camera one star
I also own a Nikon D300
But even half of my &#34;portrait&#34; pictures were out of focus and blurry
Tonight was the best of all - took a picture of the moon - you can see craters CLEARLY in the photo
I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend on our anniversary
Very good when you travel and easy to use
But it isn't any different, despite the increase in pixels
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37
It is lightweight and compact given that huge piece of glass on the front
I enjoy using this camera
If I never see it again, I won't be disappointed
Update: September 25, 2013:  I am even more impressed now with this camera and its IQ (image quality) and its features
Before leaving, I had some trouble with the lens cover closing, probably because of dirt
Love this camera
I just got back from taking pics at my daughter's Christmas program and all of my other cameras I've had there's no way I could get a good close-up shot, they would always be blurry
Interchangeable lenses are a MAJOR reason you will want this camera
On one hand, when my S8100 worked it was a nice camera
Easy to use
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
Love the zoom (WOW
It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light
I bought this camera 7 days ago
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
2- Lighting is not automatically set and after you take the picture you will find out if the brightness needs to be adjusted
VERY smal.
Great quality and the pictures are clear and it has a fast shutter speed to catch  my 18mo old son
Wow zoom
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
negatives
Awesome
I really do like it
It is a larger camera (not pocket) size
) Combined with the fact that one has to constantly switch between LCD and viewfinder by pressing a button, the low quality of the LCD and the viewfinder (the latter being horrible) makes taking pics with this camera a frustrating experience
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
The printing time for the picture isn't long at all usually a few seconds and ta-dah you have a printed picture
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
I have to say this camera has performed way beyond my expectations
Love it, great camera, lots of my friends and colleagues are impressed by it
For under $200, I think it's a great value
It's very awkward and I always worry about people touching it when I'm passing the camera around
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
I have been buying up the best cameras that still use AA batteries because; I have cerebral palsy and do not drive
If you don't care about image quality, it's a great camera
It takes excellent pictures and the video quality is really stunning
Comparing this camera to the older SX280, both cameras rendered very similar (punchy) photos in good lighting
All of my photos have turned out great and it's so easy to use
I bought this camera to use for my wedding
This camera is so much fun
But the grip bars on the front of this model help
Poor Image Quality and Clunky Design
The camera was just what I was looking for
Excellent camera
Its a good camera, have an excelent resolution and extraordinary zoom, i hope dont have inconvenients and continue using by a good time this camera
The dual controls for the telephoto are nicely placed and quite accessible
It is extremely enjoyable to take pictures with this even for a novice like me
Bought it for my daughter's graduation; she loves it
So i decided to give it a try and buy this one, since 20
Five Stars
Astonishingly even at 60x the pictures come out clear WITHOUT a bi or tripod
Again, it exists as a second camera
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
We will be traveling from AZ to AK and we'll see how the animal pics turn out
The body is all plastic expect for the hot shoe
I'm better off taking pictures with my regular camera and making wallet prints at Costco
I want to take classes and become a better photographer
If you are all about heavy, insanely expensive GEAR, buy an SLR
The panorama modes are wonderful.
I love this camera
BEFORE I removed the protective film on the screen, I used some Xylol with a Q tip to rub the lettering off, and left the film on
Best compact I have seen on the markte
Nikon s8100
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
Used at our daughters graduation outdoors
FZ70 Review
Expected better from a $500 unit.
My six year old point and shoot camera gives better quality photos and a better screen than this camera
This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
Oh, of note, the 'so called' manual settings on this camera are very poor
switches are poorly assembled and the chrome ring around the lens feel of prior to use
Ooops, I goofed
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod
The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way)
Went to Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square PA and followed my normal practice of taking an enormous number of pictures in the hope of getting a few decent shots
ConclusionThis is a low cost camera that takes great pictures
On a scale of 1 to 10,  I would give Amazon a 10 and the Nikon S8100 about a 3
Sometimes when you edit out noise, information is lost, and when I really zoom in on the photos produced at low ISO's, I think some sharpness has often been lost, and I wish the camera would leave these photos grainier, as it's always possible to edit them (sometimes better than the camera could itself) after the fact, but it's not possible to get back what's lost
Besides the normal family pictures I take lots of pictures of my kids playing basketball, football and soccer
This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
Video operation is straight forward and the finished product is great
Compared to a mirrorless camera like the Nex 3 or 5, this camera is superior in nearly every way except the size
The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
Awesome camera
You can adjust the exposure or just switch it to the exact type of setting you're in, like at a sporting event, or taking a picture of a pet, it's really easy and it takes great pictures
Between this and my LX7 I am set for awhile with cameras
We have always had trouble getting good shots of the kids during school programs due to poor lighting, I dont think that will be the problem anymore after using this camera at night
Great in dark places and long distances
Rebels ROCK: T5 vs T5i
Hey Guys, The thing has a MOTOR that works the zoom
It is much lighter and smaller than the A37
I was buying a camera solely for still photography, and, if that's what you are looking for, there is no better in this price class
I finally used it for the first time at Maroon 5's NYE show in Vegas
The "low light" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light
picture clear
Smart Camera
I also have a SonyDSC-HX20v with a 20x zoom, and I think the panasonic is easier to focus at the highest zoom than the Sony is - however both require a steady hand at full zoom
Great product for point and shoot and fun that it prints
Also, I would not expect a great deal from the image stabilization
The 30x optical zoom (with digital extension up to 120x) is astonishing
love the speed and ease of the features and captures
It was just too much for me to tolerate
Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range
There are 2 pictures with an Airstream trailer, one at no zoom, the other at 10x zoom
An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
Everyone loved those pictures and we were able to see things from a Cruise ship that we would have never seen otherwise
I had an earlier version and got familiar with the upgrade immediately
However, I do have a few things to complain about...
Great night shots but washed out in bright daylight
One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
Good telephoto and macro for internet,  and I am able to get photos of the dogs, so far I am very pleased
Very good camera for casual shooting
This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
The instructions are 3 pages and do not explain the menu functions
Excellent Product strongly suggested
SMILE
And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones
This camera takes good photos, but I am unable to download them into my ASUS tablet like I could with a previous Canon and other friend's cameras
Not What I Expected
What a GREAT camera for 98% of all my camera needs
I did not want to deal with multiple lenses but wanted a step up from my Cannon with a 20X optical zoom
This is a great little point and shoot camera
Highly recommended
The zoom on it is great and zooms in very clear
This camera worked great on my recent trip to the Butchart gardens in Victoria
It can easily handle a 16 GB memory card, and it also automatically connects to the computer for uploading pictures
It is also difficult to get clear focus when using the zoom
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
just not for me
and Panasonic delivered
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
Shooting won't take much more time
Great product
Be aware it does NOT come with a removeable memory card
; love the color
DSCX-HX5V - which I LOVE
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
After reading the reviews on several different sites and looking at ratings, this camera is well worth the money
I recommend this camera for everybody who wants to capture best pictures
A step down ring 55-52 will not work at the widest angles (~20mm-24mm)
Awesome Camera
Excellent
Fairly good camera for the price
I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
Pros: Battery life seems fair, makes excellent pictures and is very user friendly
its more like printer than polaroid
8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
But now my pics have gone from sufficient to nearly artistic
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
Even in full sun there was significant blur
I bought it very cheap from AMAZON
Great Camera
In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible
The camera is also VERY user-friendly
price7
Got it for about $200, and I won't stay awake at night about it being in the car
Then the flash cover (plastic) fell off because it is only glued on, and in Mass we have humidity and heat
1MP Camera - An excellent choice and the price is quite reasonable
I think it's a great camera for someone who knows the basic of a camera
I didn't understand, but I went in Sony store, but they, only sold me a new charger
Also The White balance was horrible
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you
I purchased this awesome camera a little over a year & a half ago and it is by far the best digital camera I have purchased by far
It wasn't as it was described
I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution
Our first good camera
My wife constantly complains about missing shots because she forgot to switch the camera back to shooting mode
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
But the best part is the video
I was thrilled to get the increased zoom and mega pixels when the FZ 40 arrived, and the image quality continued to be outstanding, although fewer images were keepers which I attributed to the difficulty of controlling hand-shake at the larger zoom factor
Flash pop up is new but getting use to it
I am impressed, and very glad I got this camera
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
The main adjustment to make is in the resolution, the default is 1080, I moved it to 1080*
The choice is between being a BIRDER, that is, using binoculars to look at birds, and being a BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER, more interested in the great photo than spotting everything
Overall, it is a fairly good camera for the price
-Powers up and is ready to shoot at the blink of an eye
Okay, here's what I hate about this camera:Pros:1) When it takes a good shot it takes a good shot
Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
I doesn't look like the plan to make a remote shutter release for this model
And the price is ridiculously low right now, I notice
Pictures look great on big flat screen TV's
This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon
Recommend buying extra battery pack and extra SD cards
This camera is very easy to use and takes high quality photos
It does not provide you that option on the menu and it does not have
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
Obviously I received defective equipment
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
Now six months later the lens error has happened again
this is my first digital camera .
EDIT: 1-13-2011We took our camera to the colts/jets playoff game and got some great video before the game and some great pictures
The video that can be taken with this camera is amazingly good, as well as the still photos
This is my third camera,all different brands,but this is great in low light and great if you have a shakie hand
All in all, very impressive camera
When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
Canon puts in software to make a virtual wi-fi connection with your cell phone so you can move pictures for sharing on social networks
The screen seems fine for this price range, the EVF is  good enough for composing images and is a big plus in bright sunlight
It ivery easy to use and does a great job
Video quality and sound is also very good
I have been VERY HAPPY with my purchase
You can not buy this camera thinking your going into a serious camera for any serious needs
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
Nice pics
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
Which I guess is OK because they turn out bad anyway ;-)Finally
Pros:-Takes amazing pictures, crystal clear even when zoomed out
works good
well worth the money
In lower light it was totally useless
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
I really love the size, feel and capabilities - excellent zoom and functions, but after only about 7 weeks of use, this camera lens locked and I got the "lens error" message - while on the second day of my vacation in Austria
The panorama assist is great and provides a better scene than the sweep panoramas I tested
Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather)
If you don't do video AT ALL, the T3 is cheaper still, and has more battery life and is an ounce lighter
I am beyond pleased and will experiment with settings other than AI
Curious to see now if it will pull into focus these Drones in the NW skyline -
Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp
At amazon
The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true
The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough
Pros: Prints great pictures with stylish borders
The camera starts up quickly and has almost no lag at all
The 'fun' part of the camera is printing images on the paper which double as stickers - while it is neat to be able to print images immediately, the glitz wears off once you realize that the images fade very rapidly - I took some pictures of employees at work when I first bought the camera and now the images are just blue blobs that resemble the employees
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
I love this camera.
I really loved the camera
It did produce good quality photos
* Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag
I do really love this camera
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
- Resolution up to 16
Flash is good and fairly powerful for a small unit, exposure mostly about right
Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light
I am using DSLR but sometimes I really need a small and talented compact camera
I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50
I bought this camera at the end of August.
Worth every penny
A lot of hype is made because this FZ70 takes photos using the RAW format, which Panasonic says is superior to the JPEG format
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
12-1-10:  The S8001 has a defect in the firmware
you can just take regular digital camera and print em at cvs or something and will have better quality photos
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
Very clear
This camera exceeded all of my expectations
This is a perfect high pixel camera with telephoto lens for travel
Good value and my daughter loves it too
The prints are small and have a sticky back but color reproduction is not always acceptable* (sometimes bueish, sometimes pinkish)
- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size)
I love this camera
Camera doesn't have a view finder but it makes up with tilt swivel screen in many direction so you can take pictures pointing above your head (if you're in crowd or if bright Sun is blaring in the middle of the day then you can Change screen position up, down or in sides
I really enjoy taking pictures but I am far from an accomplished photographer
The SD card slot is a plus
The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
The camera is fantastic
This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings
A bit large for point in shoot, but likely realistic alternative
It would be nice if the camera had a good battery that was rechargeable
I guess I got a dud but I am majorly disappointed in Nikon
After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70
Cons of this camera are lighting
The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
MACROMacros are very impressive with the FZ70
Great Product
I went back to the Cannon SX130IS which is a much better camera
The photos it takes on its tiny,3x2 overpriced film are smeary,blurry, out of focus snaps with absolutely no value
I do notice that when I shoot in flourescent lighting, there sometimes is a yellowish hue when I use the flash and the distance is a little long
My Sony HX1 was much fasterBody is a little too large (but this is a personally preference)Custom buttons have been reduced
I wrote another review and this is the update.
Sony products are the best of the best
I then realized a major design flaw.
This camera is everything I was looking for
I have no idea why Panasonic would advertise such a high powered zoom that performs so poorly
It was great, got some wonderful pictures on the oppisite side of the parade grounds
As unhappy as I have been returning the cameras, I am very impressed and grateful to Amazon for their incredibly generous and pleasant customer service
This Nikon S8100 is great camera and does great 1080P videos in every aspect except for 2:1) the FLASH photos shots are almost ALL overexposed and look HORRIBLE
Fantastic camera, I have wanted to buy this camera for some time (my son has one), finally it came down to my price range
I must have taken 300 pictures and at least 6 videos, I use standard Duracell batteries and never had a power shortage
Love it
Sounds like they have some lemons out there
I absolutely love how the pictures turn out
It seems I spent a good deal of money for a part-time camera
It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either
When I try to delete pictures on the memory card, I can't
Also, the set up for switching between high speed etc is not really intuitive, I'm still working on playing with that
got way too many blurry pictures .
Fantastic point & shoot
This is the workhorse of a point and shoot camera
However, the two features that caused me to buy this camera are a huge disappointment
This camera has survived 6 months in the harsh desert environment of Afghanistan, even survived getting blown up without any problems
It's hard to pull out the battery cover, and all the buttons are very stiff
I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
I contacted Nikon's helpsite and they said I must use only the recommended cards
works great- but low memory/battery
Picture quality on auto and scene was marginal
Disappointing
The zoom works very well
On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don&#8217;t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized
Very easy to use
It's a bit bulky, but I like how it feels in my hands
it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
Sadly, I took most of the pictures with this camera, so I have a LOT of BLURRY pictures of monuments and pictures of people whose facial features are not clear at all
So far so good
Sent camera to Nikon, Nikon claims camera is `damaged'(100 images, maybe, max, since holiday
Excellent camera
Zoom is awesome
I wish I could have gotten both at the same time
So Far The Best Pictures but Still Somewhat Weak In Low Light
Reasonably good coverage, though direct flash is never flattering for anything other than fill-flash
And when u record video in low light, it makes a movie shutter sound, which can lead to it breaking bcuz I hit it  repeatedly thinking something was jammed
I also love that I do not have to use the screen and often use the viewfinder
Very thin and light
Also, it uses a high powered light to gauge the target apparently, so it's not stealthy
Ok, so you aren't going to get super duper mega fine picture quality, but it isnt bad either
I then looked at this camera
I totally love the screen versatility
It is light and easy to hold with one hand
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
It looks very much like the rest
I've been looking for a great superzoom camera for several years, tried the Canon SX50 which is very good as well but settled on the Lumix
Flash location is a bit off, but I'll get used to holding it a little closer to the edges
Excellent Product strongly suggested
It might survive a knock or two, though
The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much
I ordered this camera with high hopes after seeing it was the #1 selling camera on Amazon at the time of purchase, and after reading many 4-star and 5-star reviews
The flash works very well and is strong enough that I really cannot complain
As you read the ones here it is easy to see the rookies, whining about everything
The huge viewscreen tilts and swivels to make it easy to take a pic of something low to the ground (resulting in lots of right up in their faces cat pictures) and its big and bright
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
you need good lighting in the room or outside in order to have a half decent picture
They are not the same, and the T5 is less expensive, though certainly a GREAT "entry level" DSLR
But otherwise, this camera is great
Macro and portrait functions work well too
Battery has lasted well over 200 pics in a variety of conditions (flash/no flash) but i am still ordered a backup for those long days of photographing things and people and stuff
The battery doesn't last all that long, especially if you print out your pictures, and I don't see why anyone would buy this camera, if they didn't expect to print pictures directly from the camera
I was looking to buy a mid price all purpose zoom camera
I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
The zoom feature works great, the macro mode is great, the low light function works great (you probably will need the flash only in a dark room)
negative points :
high quality camera
yep .
All are well made and do what you would expect
I am not a photo genius, but i definitley have learned a lot more since i recieved it 2 months ago
Only thing I'm not to happy about it the cover for where you plug in the cord for charging
Also, I think this long a telephoto really needs a much improved stabilization system, similar to Panasonic's 5-Axis stabilization
It is a product that meets specifications if Information
When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
Strange noise from the lens
She wanted a semi-professional camera for her Christmas Vacation to the Dominican Republic
This is stupidly under priced
Like I say, I got to go back to the manual
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
Good inexpensive long zoom camera
The location makes for awkward shooting (its right where everyone would hold the camera)
The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip
It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light
4) BIGGEST COMPLAINT BY FAR:  Although the camera takes great pictures in in dimly lit rooms in terms of visibility (awesome nightshot of an old town street in exas - looks like it was still dusk), but the camera is a horrific disaster when it comes to clarity
The pictures were soft and the lens was slow to focus
3- Battery is charged through USB cable and if you get spare battery it requires swapping back and forth (Battery life is not good either)I am thinking of returning this camera eventhough I like Coolpix over Sony or Cannon but I think there are set backs on this one
Things like the drumset will be in focus but anything moving like the drummer will be blurred
This matters quite a bit for panoramas
The simulated analog wheel is confusing to understand, and occupies a far bigger proportion of the display than it should - it blocks out the very subject that one is trying to photograph
At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made
Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
I had a Canon Coolpix, but this is a new and upgraded version
However, not perfect, and it could be substantially improved
Some more manual control would have been nice.
Picturetastic
It took me some time to learn how to use it, because a lot of buttons have many functions
Amazing zoom
My one complaint is that the screen is not moveable
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
Great bag with the all-important AW cover
All other functions mostly very good for price range
So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full
This camera is AMAZING, my friends have other kind of cameras and all of them said that my camera is amazing and has a great quality
It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable
And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
* A new Noise Reduction algorithm is more aggressive on low-contrast areas
there is usb , though .
This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses
It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it
This is a great value in a little interchangeable lens camera with a traditional style view finder
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
I pre-ordered and have found it to be just perfect
Keep the camera
Really great little camera
I'll keep this short and to the point
it was quite irritating
Five Stars
Body is solid despite what some reviewers said
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
Low light video is good but the more you zoom the less light you get (gee
Long battery life for still shots, short battery life for video
its cool - but photos are too small
It functions very well
This is my first digital camera and I think its awesome
The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
Others are good
Will try another brand next time
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit
Replacing a four year old Canon
However, I may have to buy another camera anyway as my friend doesn't want to part with the S8100
)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic mode
Best camera I have owned in a decade
The indoor pics are not dark
I think it will give me some great close up actions shots this summer on the lake
Picture quality is bad, shutter cant stop action, file sizes are miniscule, the in camera effects look like they're from 2004
I got this for Christmas
Nothing I don't like about it, range is the best
I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
Flash and battery door pop up seems flimsy and I felt it won't last very many use or break off on slight mishandling
Works for a basic need
maybe because it is all plastic
In fact, I am enjoying this camera more than almost any one I have ever used
I also recommend not using the continuous AF (you'll hear clicking sounds in the video)
Photos are also beautiful
I haven't used it for video, but he does and loves it
With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification
Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers
Love it
The quality of my pictures are extremely good, maybe a whisker short of digital SLR type cameras
I love the micro zoom which allows me to take excellent detailed pictures of flowers and any small item
My daughters and their friends liked the photos with colorful borders
Great camera
I did not expect a zoom camera has such good image
I am very happy with most aspects of the camera although I haven't had time to thoroughly evaluate it
Poor design decisions (probably some poor marketing influence, too):1
Convenient, easy to carry, good photos
I know exactly which camera is mine in the group on the table
She  has shown  interest in photography  and wanted her &#34;first real camera&#34;
However I do not recommend this
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
Nice pics and versatile equipment
very excited
There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all
-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
AMAZING zoom
I don't think another 12" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use
Love the camera
The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
For its price and features, this Lumix DMC-FZ70 is hard to beat
I can't emphasize this point enough: this is one of the main reasons why I bought the camera
It doesn't respond as quickly as I expected and am missing some good shots
We returned the camera
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
Love this product
Finally, some people complained about background noise while recording video at 1080p
it focuses in a snap .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
Lens quality:I am satisfied with the image quality
It looks awesome on the viewer but after the button is pushed the picture is fuzzy somewhat
The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper
*******As an update nine months later
great camera
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
my story is based on personal usage .
In a room (without flash) the camera enhanced the color and brightness, to look like a picture that processed using Photoshop, In dark room it was much worst
I did a ton of research on the camera and it's close relative out there the Canon PowerShot SX510 HS
Flexible enough for most situations, large and luminous screen
She has been enjoying  the functional ease  of it  and the nice pictures  it takes
I am looking forward to many years of taking photos with my new camera
im so disgusted and after reading nikon help center reviews I now know not to bother even calling
1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
Otherwise fantastic camera
Love this Camera highly recommennd
Since I do a lot of work on photoshop, I really appreciate the large resolution that the images come in (5152x3864)
Some notes- get the class10 memory card
3) High video resolution
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
And it's less than $60 with two extra batteries
I love this little camera
Bottom line, whatever camera, in my book it isn't the camera itself
The camera operates very easy, if you have used a digital camera in the past this should be no different
When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button
That's a big difference
Find it expensive for what it is
lovely camera
For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
I also didn't like that the flash is manual
I've come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist
Took 45 minutes of video and camera was still going strong
I just don't know how much more research I could have done
The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still
5) I can't get the battery to last more than 35 minutes
The owners manual is way too brief and doesn't give enough details on how to use all the features or easy ways to access them
I'm a mom of two small children, I work full-time and I'm a grad student - I don't have time to spend making my pictures better with software
that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
Buy some extra batteries
The hot shoe design is not perfect
I had to buy an extra memory stick but it's worth it
I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice
No issues in this department
Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
BOTTOM LINE: BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND GREAT FOR STILLS, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON TRYING TO SHOOT ANY MOVING OBJECTS FORGET ABOUT THIS CAMERA
First off, let me say that I am not a pro, or even a hobbyist photographer
I have a 50x zoom camera also-but I tend to use this one most of the time-because I can stick it in my purse or pocket-which I can't do with my other one
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
big mistake .
I am having fun zooming in on very small images from across the room
best camera in its class by far
I am a hands on person and learn better by experimenting with the camera than reading the instruction manual
The biggest problem and most annoying is the door that holds the film in place opens at the slightest touch
Lots of cool settings, far zoom, amazing quality videos and pictures
the A37 operates the same way
Softer than the F3Previously in Auto mode, the Nex won't allow you to change shooting mode via the custom buttons; you have to go through the menu system
It has a wide zoom range allowing it to capture both wide views and incredible closeups of distant objects - birds and monkeys in this case
Both of our point and shoots suffered from being dropped and broken battery doors
This was the great selling point of their cameras
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
It felt a little like finding the needle in the haystack
Cons: Action shots are blurry even with stable hands, no view finder
)Note:  I first tried the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19
I thought this would be a wonderful idea for a wedding guest book but the quality of the pictures were poor and it was too small
The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom
This is not my primary digital camera
it 's a winner .
The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc
There is a lot of value in the features
An extra step I wish I didn't have to remember to do
I had a couple of issues with this camera
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
Also I found the camera to be very prone to silhouetting and washout in outdoor use, and again this is not simply operator error, I am comparing to other similarly-priced cameras I have owned over the years (including various Casio Exilim and Fujifilm FinePix models)
After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body
My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show
Love the Nikon Coolpix l830
The best thing about this camera, is that you can literally just pick it up and shoot the picture and get gorgeous results, the second best thing about it is the zoom - at 60x you can zoom to your hearts content
Absolutely PHENOMENAL
Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling
it is larger then you think trust me but on a good note it does exactly what they said and it does it's job well
Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
I too would have to agree it is annoying and I often forget to move my fingers as I am not quite used to its location
8 II Camera LensThe best part about this amazing lens is that it's less than $100
The biggest problem with the video is that you can hear the noise of the zoom when you zoom in & out during video shooting
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
If it cant focus it flashes a red parentheses around the subject and doesnt shoot
love, love, love this point and shoot camera
The zoom is fantastic
As stated in some other reviews, the flash comes up where your finger typically rests, but I have just learned to move my finger out of the way
When I looked at the image on m computer screen, I can actually see the pixel noises
Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
Only flaw is that I tend to hold the camera with my left fingers on the top of the case, but that prevents the flash from popping up
Now as I operate everything I can't understand what it was that was so complicated for me
This is an awesome camera
I chose it because it is a 20 mp digital
This camera is bulletproof.
You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto
We have ordered 3 of these camera's
Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs
I was able to pull it out of the box and start taking pictures right away
Still trying to figure out some settings, but it's not a disappointment
Very disappointing
because this camera is beautiful .
I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job
Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer
Camera is a paper weight.
Good point and shoot
Added 9/24/13 this is by far an amazing camera~~ You need to read the manual which is in PDF form to grasp everything you can do with this
After quite extensive testing comparing the zooms on my FZ150 with the FZ70 I decided to return the FZ70
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
2) the controls are NOT intuitive and are semi difficult to useI bought this camera in December 2010 and if I had to decide again, I would have / should have bought the more intuitive Cannon
Very very nice pics, the &#34;auto modes&#34; work great,
I am disappointed though that FZ70 doesn't have capability and or plug in for external remote, although the zoom is excellent and you can get close enough to actually see the surface of the moon and or zoom in distant object or birds as they were at your hand reach
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
Nikon Coolpix S8100
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
I was able to shoot at max zoom and get good results hand holding the camera
Pictures taken in low light with no flash come out beautiful as well - in fact, I haven't used the flash on it yet
I've had this camera for about two months now, and so far I would NOT recommend it
First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality
and I don't shoot much video
I am very pleased with this camera
Others have written plenty about the pros and cons
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
 am so glad I bought this camera.
It takes incredible pictures and the quality is excellent
I was about 300 feet away from the stage, I just set the widest aperture it would let me at whatever zoom I had it, which was I think 4, ISO was between 400-800
Your photos would come out darker if you're zooming in far out subject on cloudy day but with 34x zoom you should be using a tripod and taking photo when there is suffrciant light behind you and onto the subject, camera does compensate for shake but that is more effective when you're taking a portrait but when you're zoning in 30 times even a slight hand shake will multiply 30 times
Just isn't fast enough and I always get a blur
So far I love it
This is a very high quality camera
How can you beat that?Oh, and the color of the red camera is the most gorgeous shade of red I've ever seen
I got a picture of a bald eagle, sitting on a telephone pole, on the other side of the Yellow River, must have been 60-70 yards away
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
I took this to a party and everyone wanted a picture
Fits well in the hand
I'm new at photography, but this camera is so easy to operate
I have not yet tested the video so I cannot vouch for the quality there
WONDERFULL
Nice looking camera, inexpensive, average photos
My S8100 is being returned to Amazon for a refund as I have to give up on Nikon
if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
I love this camera, I can zoom and take pictures of all the beautiful flowers, birds, bees, butterflies
I don't like the battery and battery charger set-up either
Although, if Nikon decides to add a night vision capability to this camera, sign me up
Overall, it's a good camera and takes good quality pictures
This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook)
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
really?I can't believe a camera released in 2014 wouldn't come with an orientation sensor, but if you take a lot of pictures, this is a deal-breaker
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
still zippo
One of the features I love about this camera is all the special effects you can shoot pictures with
It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes
The photo quality is excellent
Fantastic camera - great pictures / video
The camera is not to heavy to carry all day
pets and flowers, and every single picture is beautiful
Quality point-and-shoot camera that is easy to use
Its awful
The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application
Mediocre Camera for the Price
Defective piece
Menu is not all that intuitive
20MP allows me to crop images without losing detailNoise is very well controlledGrip is very good
Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
I found both AF and low light performance very good
We bought a competing product -- for quite less money
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
This is a replacement of one just like it someone dropped while trying to take our picture
For the price is an extremely great camera
It was fun experimenting with the different scene modes at dusk
Beware
Killer Camera with Amazing Battery Life
right where your left finger holds the camera
com say they will fit the somewhat more "square" geometry of the S8100 in point-and-shoot pouches designed for the Lumix or Elph
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
Comes with a decent kit lens that alone should have cost 200$
Another excellent (and cheaper) alternative is the Samsung WB350 (I have reviewed that camera too on Amazon)
It replaces another Nikon camera that I dropped
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
I've only had it for a week but I can see it being my best friend soon
Throw away the magnetic case
i agree with the positive reviews .
Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted
If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
Very hard to see the picture in bright sunlight
Give me a scroll wheel to go through images and setting and for God's sake give me a view finder
Easy to operate
But for the rest of us, this FZ70 is an extraordinary camera, even though its long-telephoto lens speed is less than that of the FZ150 or 200
I was meeting up with friends in Guangdong so I had my wife buy another of the same model
Would recommend for beginners or someone who wants good simple shots of their vacation
I just returned from a 3 week vacation to three national parks
But the pictures are just as good as always
I wanted a camera I could be comfortable with, not spend too much time setting up my shots, and still get a great picture in the end
Unfortunately the video mike isn't that great, can't pick up cat purring unless right on top of camera & lots of background noise
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
The zoom and focus are relatively quick and quiet
If you do not really need all that zoom, the sx280 may be a better way to go
All around a great camera for an amateur like me
00 so I began my search for a new camera
Nikon COOLPIX L830
The resolution of the screen and low light pictures are terrible
The price seems good at first but you have to pay a thousand dollars to get the zoom that my little sony has
Nikon Coolpix S8100 is totally cool
Got this for my wife
The printer is ok, most of the pictures have little tiny lines over them but they were printed out of the camera so it's ok, I guess
I love the camera.
You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
but canon never fails to amaze .
I said, can your fancy camera do that?
I put a 128MB CF card in it.
I bought a kodak camera which I returned because it was terrible and this nikon has been a wonderful replacement
This is really too bad because the camera has so many great features and works for 95% of the photos I want to take
Will be shipping it out tomorrow and will update for your information when I have the refund in place
The pictures are great
he say the pix are great
another amazing example of the low light quality in videos
Great camera
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
A little bigger and heavier than I expected
The eyepiece view finder is just ok but I prefer to shoot with this rather than the 3&#34; LCD viewer
However, if high-resolution, sharp, clear images that capture the beauty of nature in its most realistic rendering is a priority for you, as it is for me, your best bet is to by a used FZ 40, or a FZ 35
Excellent features for low-light photography -- including a double-exposure mode to capture that great sunset with your foreground subjects illuminated with flash
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
It's light but it's solid with a nice rest for my thumb
great resolution, battery life is fantastic, love that you can turn the camera on before removing the lens cap without grinding the motor like on the Nikon P 500
Five Stars
A great little camera, but I returned for a Panasonic w/ viewfinder
It takes a little getting used to but highly recommend it
Great camera
I plan on taking it on vacation so I will run it through the gauntlet then
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
It's just some of the coloring that is off when they print, but it takes great digital pictures and I have always wanted a Polaroid and this one does the trick for my price range
I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
8) As for "plenty of options", a cheap FUJI cam had more options than this thing
Second, it doesn't come with a separate battery charger, so, if you have a spare battery, you have to use the camera to charge it, which is not as convenient
The color on the printed 2X3 is inconsistent, sometimes very orangish
I'm very impressed with the quality of the images I've taken so far
just wish it worked
Finding your target in the zoom mode is a little difficult, and takes some getting used to, camera shake can cause some problems, but overall it is an excellent camera
I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
Affordable and nice features
Excellent Camera
Sometimes if you just point-and-shoot in auto mode, and take a flash photo, the result can be pretty awful
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings
The second one I received was also defective, however since it was pass the original 14 day return policy, there was nothing I could do about it
card reader is included .
Video is captured by pressing a prominent "Movie" button adjacent to the viewfinder
I think the one most important issue I've noticed is for all its power, the batteries seem to last forever
I tried out the comparable Canon and Lumix before deciding on this one
I am overall pleased with the camera and how easy it is to use
A good, good, good (bridge) camera
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
First Nikon S8100 camera had a defective lens and was replaced by Amazon
Since I was not going to be using this for videos, I decided to try it
Indoor flash photography
The printed pictures are quite small and the quality is not that good
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera
Aloha
This was the only camera I played with that met the criteria
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
Beautiful image stabilization, especially at 30x without tripod or mono
Nikon S8100, I love it
I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
I can take pictures so much faster than before and don't have to wait to look at the picture or for it it process
Easy to use and 60x zoom is awesome
Well worth the buy
The user interface is simple, fast, and easy to navigate
We used it for my Mom's Christmas card photo and they turned out really nice
For fun only and not for good quality print
The images were superb and the ease of operation was perfect for my armature skill level
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
Takes good photos, printing is fun
The NX2000 and the DSLR were almost equal in outdoor sunny day photograpy, but the Panasonic quality was not there
Both have the same sensor so they both perform about the same image-quality wise
It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
Great camera
I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos
and I don't miss not having a viewfinder
The face recognition system works really well, how did they get it to do that?5
For one thing, I like having 2 batteries that I can charge and swap
That is available in &#34;P&#34;(program) mode
It takes great shots and the flexible viewfinder display is great for taking picture's in a crowd
The package didnt contain the leather pouch or 4GD SDHC card as promised at the checkout
At first, I was concerned that this little camera would be what I was looking for to use
I want to "love" this camera, but right now I just "like" it
It's a similar &#34;bridge&#34; camera, fitting between point and shoot and DSLR, but is now several years behind the times
Love this camera
In the end I can't see how they can justify the cost
It is a lot better the the previous camera that I bought and sent back to Amazon
COM
No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
I ended up using photoshop and picasa to edit the pictures to try and make it look "professional" something I didnt expect to do by purchasing this camera
I graded the Panasonic with  3 stars, as it is reasonably priced for whatever you get
The tripod mount is not aligned with the axis of the lens--it is offsetted to the right side of the camera by about 2
And the video quality is amazing.
Great battery life and easy to use controls
easy to use
The user interface is extremely intuitive and the picture quality is outstanding
Blur blur blur blur blur
I suggest reading the manual and learning as much as you can about the settings it does have
takes good pictures for what i needed it for
This is really too bad, but their reputation is shot
When the camera works the pictures are beautiful and the camera is easy to use as well
What complicates matters is that the Canon Rebel SL1 is in the same neighborhood price wise and comes with the better 18-55 STM lens, better LCD (though not that much better), better burst performance and is in a more compact body
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
(4) Image stabilization works really well, which I'm sure contributes to (3), but it also contributes to low shutter-speed far-zoomed-out pics as well
These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
I was looking for a camera a long time ago, but I didn't know wich one to buy
I have never been a fan of point and shoots for my serious photography, always relying on one of Canons
4, The images are not very sharp
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
I don't own a lot of compact cameras
For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package
The pictures are unbelievable and the videos are great
It wastes storage space in the SD card
I really love this camera because of the zoom
I started using it straight out of the box without having to read a book of instructions
I was looking to replace my old Canon Powershot that's an ultracompact
The LCD screen is horrible quality as well
did not give it 5 stars because it does not include case
I haven't been disappointed
I am in love with my camera
Bought this camera for my boyfriend and he was so excited when he opened the box but it is true that the battery does not last long and the worst part of it is that the print quality is terrible
I am just a beginner in the world of photographn but this Nikon Coolpix L830 makes me feel like a photographer with ideas far beyond my novice station
The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video
The battery life is good too
It is a little more involved than a traditional point and shoot camera
Perfect Balance of Zoom and Quality
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
it has great wide angle at the other end
The pocket camera does what it was designed to do
It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it
The only problems I've run into is I didn't realize there was no manual mode, and when its at its highest zoom it make a beeping nose( does not interfere with video)
Terrific little camera
2) Much better in low light than a $100 cheaper camera I bought
Very disaapointed
The buttons are rather stiff.
Easy to Use and awesome close-ups
The pictures are kind of blurry after printing
I'll start with what the camera does well: it does fit in the small hip pocket of my backpack, which was a prerequisite as this was to be my camera for long-distance backpacking trips
It is not by any means for serious photographers or anyone that wants to take a family portrait
The images are sharp and the colors are beautiful
I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR
Outdoors, full zoom is marvelous
It's a bit big and not very suited for travelling/For a well balanced camera with good quality and zoom, you may consider the following sony model
Hate to wait between shots
Delighted with this product
You also have access to your photos digitally as well which is not the case with other point-shoot-print cameras
Great instant fun
The one I have is still under warranty, but after reading other people's experiences with Nikon service, I don't know if it is worth digging up the receipt and trying to get a replacement
My only disappointment is that it takes more time to focus when using the zoom than I would have thought
In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
After extensive testing with some of the different settings I can tell you the camera exceeds in many areas
6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera
The pictures are very sharp and the zoom is good
Takes awesome pictures
Good image quality.
Nice clear picture and great zoom capabilities
The picture quality was above my expectations and my only complaint is; if it so happens a drink or any other object bumps the picture while it is printing it will cause some smearage or an inconvenient black spot or two
The photos are crystal clear and true to color
THe clarity of it is wonderful and it is extremely easy  to use
This is my third one, and it's a beauty
they were really surprising SOOC
It makes great low-light pictures, something that my old camera wasn't doing
for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
Excellent
I am used to pulling out my camera, hitting the on button and shooting quickly
I thought the unit was a little cheaply made but hope it works well after I get the hang of operating it properly
A super big disappointment
Easy to use
It comes out darker and blurrier
I took about 1200 photos on that trip without a hitch
Love this
The A3000 is definitely a step forward from the smaller NEX bodies and outperforms them in some aspects including response
Convenient case by the way
well, this is the perfect camera
In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually
i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
This camera has it ALL and more
Today, I am sending to repair shop - lens will not retract
Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
00 off, if purchased with this camera
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
I then bought a Panasonic that I used a lot and really liked but after 4 years I thought I could get a better camera
Having fun with this camera
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot
Super cool
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
I would reccomend this to everyone
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
This camera exceeded my expectations
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
PROTECT YOUR CAMERA
Nice camera, very simply to use
I understand you can buy a separate battery-charger
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
Remarkable closeups
Beware of battery life
I anticipated the arrival of this product for about a week and I was very excited when it was delivered but was immediately disappointed upon using it for the first time
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
Just what  wanted
Zoomed in to take a  nice still picture,  and the deer looks like it was standing right in front of her
Great compromise
took pictures of granddaughters prom in front of window no back lighting
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
used flash as successed
It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
This camera is excellent
Weight: yes it weighs a little more but feels solid
Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
the HD is so TRUE [used it for almost anything] The built in mic is no good, but with external mic, you'll get an awesome video in HD
I can see the screen fine, but I can also see that the camera is not being held rock steady
Problem continued; contacted Nikon at about day 110
- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact
The old POGO film works with this camera and is cheaper than the Z2300 film
1) for it on their website, but you have to buy a SD card reader/writer and implement the fix with a computer yourself
This is the best point and shoot camera
And, I liked the Nikon's tilted screen
I found the menu to be clunky, and many basic features like shutter and aperture settings, manual focus (or at least a user-selected Macro mode) were either lacking entirely or buried in some menu that I couldn't find when I needed it
I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase
I ordered this camera for a European trip because I did not want to lug around my large and heavy Canon 40D, and I wanted higher quality photos that can be achieved from a cell phone
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
So based on the previous reviewers who give their pros and cons, thank you so much
crystal clear photos
The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
I have returned it and am now on the hunt again for a new camera
Very easy to use as well
Favorable reviews insist on the excellent price of this camera
Perfect camera, feels good and sturdy, takes excellent pictures
It is fairly light and the design is good, a good grip and feels balanced
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
Love it
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
We ordered this as a gift for our son's graduation
Full HD 1920 x 1080, 60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format
In love
hard to go wrong with this machine
The first camera I received drained a fully charged battery after 4 photos and would not take video, it just shut off and said change the batteries
Perfect
It was also very easy to switch from still pictures to video
Excellent camera
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
good
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
Wonderful camera
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
I can most closely compare them to a $150 dollar pocket camera
Missing features&#8230;
As compared to other point and shoot cameras, the quality and detail is hands down better
I started having fun again
It's great for what it is
Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
I managed a lot of shots in Africa while the SLR crowd was fumbling with lenses that cost three- to five-times (or more) what my whole camera cost
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality
Pictures in a sunny day the images were nice, but a bit soft
The only thing is when we ask other people to take pictures of our family for us, the pop up flash can be hard if people don't know about it/aren't used to it
i love the camera since the day that i saw it, is really easy to use i didn't have any problem with the camera, the only thing is when you print the pic thre is a space in the end of the paper that is not good is weird
I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
First off, I am very happy with my purchase
Still learning some things
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
Then came the S8100 Nikon ; Built like a brick,
If you really want a good price camera go for at least a EOS Rebel T5i
and now I'm going to return it
Perfect for outdoors
I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake
let me say first off that it works great in full auto mode  iA mode
The color is slight-moderately better & resolution much better/clearer than Sony Cyber-shot
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
I limped a long with the camera, taking once in a lifetime pictures with a lens that made it look like the camera had a cataract
This is a great camera that makes excellent pictures
Good camera, recommend
Sent to Nikon and I'm still waiting after a month in their shop
Polaroid camera, an excellent fishing sinker
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
Disappointment
If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
Excellent value for money
This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
The scene settings are very thorough - you can choose between night time / day time / sports and many more
easy to use
Shipped quickly
This one I could zoom right up to her face and it was crystal clear
This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
perfect gift
SO in the end, would I buy again?
LOVE THIS CAMERA
I am very please with my purchase of the Nikon COOLPIX L830
I'll let you know how things go for me
It also doesn't automatically reposition pics taken in portrait mode (you'll need to put the camera upright to review)
It is interesting that there are so many negative reviews on this product - but in looking at them most of them are related to the video quality, not still image which is uniformly rated 5, or in only some cases a 4
I'll update in 30-45 days if any issues arise, but it is exactly what I felt it should be, and the $$ is fairly set
Several cameras are far superior in performance and features at similar price points
The T5 has a much more comfortable grip and feels more solid in the hand
battery seems to last long so far
This is an amazing piece of technology for the price
I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
less than a year, so many issues OMG really? I have had cheapos from walmart lasting 20 years, I also own $2000 cameras and never an issue, btw they are canon's, but wanted a small light weight camera and nikon was suppose to be good
Get Camera even comes with a rechargeable battery which is semi charged
Cell phone take better pictures
You have to physically spread the lens covers apart until they stay apart
I would like to say a little more about the image stabilization
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries
In the meantime, I've missed having the camera for my family vacation - ugh
Just what I was looking for
And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder
Some nice features, nice to be able to print pictures
My main issue with it is, however, the inability to connect to my computer to transport the files quickly
Simple fast control buttons for the most used functions
I t has the perfect size and
I am shooting the neighbors flowers one petal at a time
If you decide to buy one of these cameras, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
A little on the small side but the photos are great
Great value, Awsome zoom
The pictures have been greaat so far
Cool idea but bad execution
ONE FABULOUS PHOTO TAKER
2) Flash can easily wash out the subject if you are too close
I took a couple of pictures with this came and they came out so beautiful
The camera is light and has a great sensor, but it's a pain to shoot
Here's my experience with it for the past year:The bad:-about 1/10 pictures in lower light areas would come out COMPLETELY whitewashed, no matter the setting I used-it was really difficult to focus it on up close things-it took forever to focus-I'm now getting lens error readings (and, like I said, I've had it for only a year)-it randomly deleted my graduation photos
If they do fix it, I'll give it to my kids and let them play with it
Excellent Product
I was able to get a little bit, but nothing very impressive
The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
Would buy again
It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter
I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this camera
I had a Canon TSi for 5 years and recently my large zoom lens stopped working
It is attractive and well designed
I dont mind how the flash needs to pop up, it was an easy adjustment to make
I love the tilt-able/extendable screen for shooting overhead or waist high photos
0 port and it cannot send data at it's full capacity, and says this for every USB port on my tower
Blueberry with Nikon S8100
Or if you are on vacation and wish to use it every day, just prepare ahead of time by buying a spare battery and make sure both are charged every night so that you have fresh fully-charged batteries come morning
He took great shots
You can download the pictures using USB without having to take the memory card out
In fact there was a topless sunbather in one that I hadn't seen and my son was delighted that I got such a sharp, focused shot
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting
There are so many features, it can be difficult to figure out the one you want to use on the fly
The processor is able to keep up with the 1080i video at 60 fps with no blur during pans or when recording fast objects
I'm going to return this and check out the amazon reviews to try a different camera, any recommendations for good cameras for taking sport shots??
and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well
I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before
Usually, it is deemed that low price mean low quality but this digital instant print camera proved it wrong
Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x)
I am somewhat disappointed in the burst mode of this camera
A fine light camera
She was thrilled
i highly recommend it .
IT would be nice if you could set a zoom limit
HAPPY
Nikon does have a newer model out (Coolpix S9100) but I didn't see the point in spending the extra money, especially since the differences between the 2 models are minimal
0 MEGAMIXEL Cybershot DSC-H55
This Nikon Coolpix L830 takes four AA batteries so it is a bit of a battery hog but, I feel the batteries last longer
Had to send it back sadly
It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47
For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera
i love it
(I did not want to be the person kicked out of an awards show)
So far, even with a polarizer, the photos were a little overexposed and it took a while until I found the exposure compensation control so that my pictures could be slightly underexposed, giving me more saturation
Anyone can use it
One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is "A3000", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number "ILCE-3000')
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
