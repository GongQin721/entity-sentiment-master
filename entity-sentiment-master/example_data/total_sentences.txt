Very nice camera
Last month my 2 year old t3 stopped working and displayed an error 20 on the screen
the lowest price I could find for a repair was $200
00 so I began my search for a new camera
I really enjoy taking pictures but I am far from an accomplished photographer
I couldn't see the point in getting another t3 so I read up on Canon's other models
Articulating screens are not necessary for me and I'm not overly impressed with touch screens
The t5 seemed to be the right fit for me, more megapixels along with tried and true technology
The Digic 4 processor is a fabulous processor and I loved it in my t3
Because the t5 is just a beefed up t3 I can use the same batteries, SD card and battery grip I had for my t3
So far I have taken a few hundred photos an I am more than pleased with the results
My only wish is that the t5 had come with the sensor cleaning function Canon's earlier models came with
I am looking forward to many years of taking photos with my new camera
This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting
To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography
The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses
These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations
And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also
Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3
The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one
It has an articulating LCD screen and the LCD screen has more pixels I really recommend it over this camera and it's even cheaper
I put it on par even with the Canon T5i
so be sure to check it out I think the T3i is the camera to get at the present time
The number one reason to get a camera like this is the full manual controls over such things as shutter speed and aperture
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras that you can buy today for under $200 don't allow you to adjust these things but really if you're serious about photography learning how shutter speed and aperture work together to create photographs is very important
And the fact that this camera allows you to control these features and so many more manually means you can make great photographs
Notice I said make better photos instead of take better photos that is because by learning how shutter speed and aperture work together you will be able to create photos where regular point-and-shoot cameras would fail
Interchangeable lenses are a MAJOR reason you will want this camera
8 II Camera LensThe best part about this amazing lens is that it's less than $100
And the cool thing is you can get a lot of different lenses relatively cheap for these Canon cameras
The lens that comes with this camera is ok but it's lowest f-stop is 5 and that is bad in low light situations
I definitely recommend the 50mm linked above as it helps learning the manual controls of this camera
HOW APERTURE AND SHUTTER SPEED WORK: (The following was taken from my 50mm lens review but it walks you through understanding shutter speed and aperture)Here I'll explain how the f-stop or aperture priority works on digital SLR cameras
8 allows you to shoot at faster shutter speeds in low light situations because the circle in the lens allows more light to pass through because of the lower aperture
There is also Av mode where the camera allows you to adjust the aperture of the lens while it handles the shutter speed
And then finally on that dial there is the magic M and that is manual mode and that's where you get to set the shutter speed and aperture for yourself
If you follow the tips and step-by-step above even if you just use the lens included you will get better at photography
HD video: One of my favorite things about this line of cameras is you can shoot video at 1080p which is very high-resolution and looks great on high definition televisions and even on YouTube
And with the fact you can use interchangeable lenses you can really start to do some amazing things with your video
Dropping your f-stop to 1
8 on the 50mm lens and being able to shoot 1080p video is really incredible
Those are my three main reasons why these canon cameras are the BEST for new photographers and even videographers nowadays
I also TOTALLY RECOMMEND getting the battery grip:Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release for Canon Rebel T2i, T3i, T4I, T5i,Digital SLR Cameras with 2 Extra LP-E8 Extended Life High Capacity Batteries, Wireless Infrared Remote and Lens Cleaning KitThey add so much to this camera as far as feel
Plus the extra battery life is so useful
And it's less than $60 with two extra batteries
Hope this helps thanks for reading this wall of text
My Canon EOS Rebel T5 - love it
When I received my camera I was so excited
I read thru the handbook just to get the basics and it is so easy to use
I absolutely love how the pictures turn out
I do not regret my purchase
Rebels ROCK: T5 vs T5i
The Rebel line of Canons has produced some incredible cameras such as the T3
These are considered "budget" or beginner DSLR's but in actuality, they are packed with features and unless you are a pro, you won't need much more in a DSLR
They also have the ability to take video
There is a T5 and a T5i and it's not easy to tell what the differences are
CAREFUL
They are not the same, and the T5 is less expensive, though certainly a GREAT "entry level" DSLR
(Digital single lens reflex--a camera you can change lenses to add a telephoto or a wide angle lens like the pros do
)The MAIN difference between the two is in the screen resolution: 460,000 dots for the T5 vs 1,040,000 dots in the T5i
That's a big difference
If you do a lot of video, the T5i would be better
You can blow up your pictures on the screen much larger
Another screen difference: the T5i swivel screen is better for video (swings out like a video camera
) The touch screen makes manual settings a breeze
The T5 has a fixed screen like the T3
The T5 is lighter
Doing a lot of low-light work? The ISO range of the T5i is larger: T5 100 - 12,800 vs T5i 100 - 25,600The T5i has a 9 point cross-type Autofocus  vs only 1 in the T5The T5 has about 100 shots MORE of battery life than the T5i
If you are shooting a lot of video with a DSLR, you'll probably want the T5i
If you are shooting a lot of low-light, you may also want the T5i
If you want a very light camera, with more battery life and to save some money, the T5 is excellent
If you don't do video AT ALL, the T3 is cheaper still, and has more battery life and is an ounce lighter
The video resolution on the T5 is better than the T3 and there is an auto-contrast detection
Summary: Video and still shooters--T5i is best, T5 is good
T3 is best for still shots and is cheaper, has more battery life
Save some money and buy an EOS T5i
It is a camera for starters but it can't be compare even with an old Canon EOS T1i
If you really want a good price camera go for at least a EOS Rebel T5i
However, a T2 is a lot cheaper and works better
I have been having my T2 for some years now for sports photography
I have this T5 but it stays in bag when doing shots
Not a ground-breaking product, but solid and dependable nonetheless
Like it's predecessor, the Canon T5 is a no-frills DSLR whose primary focus is taking decent pictures
And for the most part, despite what DxoMark and others say about it, it excels at this task
The camera has no major quirks or malfunctions, it just works
Image quality is very good
With great color, good detail capture, decent exposure, and solid (but not class-leading) high ISO performance
The camera takes clean photos through ISO800, and still performs fairly decently through ISO3200
Canon does a decent job balancing out noise, noise reduction, and detail retention in the JPEGS as you go up the ISO scale
Raw files from this camera provide a lot of flexibility for post processing
You get the same 18-55 IS II lens that came with the T3
However, while the lower resolution sensor on the T3 tended to mask a lot of the flaws of the lens, on the T5 and its higher resolution sensor, not so much
The softness of the kit lens is quite evident when paired with the T5
If you buy this from a reputable brick and mortar camera dealer, they might actually let you immediately trade in the 18-55 and put it towards a nicer lens
What complicates matters is that the Canon Rebel SL1 is in the same neighborhood price wise and comes with the better 18-55 STM lens, better LCD (though not that much better), better burst performance and is in a more compact body
Both have the same sensor so they both perform about the same image-quality wise
So why would you choose the T5 over the SL1? It really all comes down to the handling
I really honestly don't see how anybody with larger hands could find the SL1 comfortable to shoot with given its very shallow grip
The T5 has a much more comfortable grip and feels more solid in the hand
Meaning it can stand up better to heavier lenses
However, if the shallow grip doesn't bother you and you want the newer kit lens plus the touch screen, by all means, get the Rebel SL1
Autofocus performance is pretty good although it's essentially the same AF system as before
But overall it's fast and dependable
The camera in general has good performance in the speed area, although burst performance has only improved marginally over its predecessor
Handing has greatly improved on the T5 over the T3
The body is still plastic but the materials are higher end this time around and you actually get a proper textured grip
Control layout is largely unchanged and remains pretty straight-forward to operate
The viewfinder remains the same
And it's okay as viewfinders go
The LCD screen resolution doubled
It doesn't provide as detailed a view as some of the higher resolution screens on the T5i and 70d but it is equally viewable in direct sunlight
Battery life remains decent but it's somewhat shorter than the T3
I have not yet tested the video so I cannot vouch for the quality there
This is a camera that is not exciting in the respect that it doesn't have a lot of high tech bells and whistles but it does do well in the primary aspect in which you would expect a camera to perform well, which is taking nice photos
It's not suitable for action photography, but for all other kinds of photographic situations, it's certainly up to the task
It has no major flaws and can be counted to operate reliably every time
It's basic design and straight-forward operation make it a great choice for students or someone who wants something that can give them better image quality than their phone or point and shoot
But I think photographers of all ages and experience levels will enjoy shooting with this camera
Very nice zoom, now I can get decent pictures of my child's sports events from the sidelines
Macro and portrait functions work well too
Very nice initial impression
My wife just purchased this camera for her upcoming trip abroad,so I can't give it any more than three stars at this point as I have'nt had the chance to fully check it out,but my initial impression is that I'm very impressed with the quality
It has a great zoom,has the latest Digic 6 Image Processor,shoots awesome video,and is made in Japan
I've been a Canon fan for years and we have two others besides this one
When my wife returns I will be able to give an update response so stay tuned
Does well in good light situations
The point and shoot capability is good
At the upper end of the zoom range, the focus is a little soft
The zoom works well for static objects but not so well (in my hands) with fast moving objects
Battery life fair
Flash coverage was good for portrait situations
I don't use WiFi or smartphone functions
Couple of nice features
Compact and light enough to cart around when space is on budget
I don't do any video, so can't comment on that
Thanks for Canon Camera great and small in size and the most beautiful pictures of the property Send Mobile and zoom Excellent
Great compact camera that probably rivals entry level DSLR models
Amazing camera
upgraded from an PowerShot SX260
We purchased primarily because we were heading to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks for our honeymoon and wanted something that could zoom (30x) far for those distant shots of potential wildlife
We were not disappointed at all
We were able to take some great shots both near and far
My only grip is that taking panoramic shots requires software to piece the images together later (image names for panoramic shots get names )
My Samsung S5 was used for all our panoramic shots
Anyway, Canon has upgraded the battery capacity so we were able to shoot 12 hour days touring the park at multiple stops without swapping batteries, however, I did disable GPS and NFC radios to avoid drain from those features
(BTW - Vivatar makes cheap higher capacity batteries for this camera I later discovered) Overall, this camera is large for a pocket camera and fairly heavy but it is packed with features and a great zoom that honestly is at the limit of being functional at full zoom (30x max zoom requires bracing your arms to stay on target)
I think the manual features available also make this a real competitor to a small lens, entry level DSLR
Unless you love lugging around a full sized DSLR, this camera will perform 90%+ of what you want while still fitting in a large pants pocket or purse with a simplified user interface and fast startup for quick shots
30x Optical Zoom Works Great, the best compact camera with zoom
I bought this to use on a trip to the Amazon to spot animals, figuring I will need the zoom to take good photos of them up in the trees and in a distance
This little camera worked great
With the zoom, I got all kinds of great photos of the animals from a distance, very sharp too, some photos look almost as good as my husband's digital SLR with longer lens
There are lots of options on the camera, but the instruction manual that comes packaged with it is totally useless, only shows you how to work the basic function to take pictures, so I had to experiment with the different settings to find what works best
This was annoying
Also, with the zoom extended to the max, sometimes it takes a little time for lens to focus sharply on the object, playing with the settings for the focus area helps
The video works great also and zoom works equally well for the video
Overall, very satisfied with this camera, would not have been able to get the awesome pics of the animals without the zoom
This camera comes with wifi transfer of photos, have not set it up yet so can't speak to that at this point
Love this little camera
This is great
This is a very high quality camera
It is a little bulkier than most of the compact cameras but the added features make this very compelling
It  has  a very fast processor,  long optical zoom
Very good contrast
If you want a bridge between a digital 35mm and the little point and shoot or cell phone cameras this Canon SX700 should be considered
Canon puts in software to make a virtual wi-fi connection with your cell phone so you can move pictures for sharing on social networks
Loving it so far
It's been over ten years since I got my last camera, my first digital one
This is such a vast improvement over that first one that it's hard for me not to be enthusiastic about it
Yes, as some of the reviewers have pointed out, there are some design issues maybe, some things that could be better, but overall, I have been very pleased
It took a little playing to get it to connect with my iPad the first time, but wow, what a nice feature
The zoom is great -- I took pictures of the moon during the blood moon eclipse without using a tripod and loved the pictures I got
And using the low light setting, such as what you would use with a birthday cake with candles type of picture, works amazingly well
I can't wait to use this on our Alaska trip, the reason I sprung for a new camera this year
I did tons of research and finally settled on this one with the price range I had
Unfortunately, the unit I received didn't focus consistently at all at the longer focal length
It was as if the camera was constantly seeking focus
In lower light it was totally useless
Otherwise the size, controls and handling of the camera were fine
It took decent picture at short and medium focus lengths
Also, I think this long a telephoto really needs a much improved stabilization system, similar to Panasonic's 5-Axis stabilization
I think the focus hunting condition with mine may have just been a condition of the unit I received but I don't want to take a chance on another unit
I'll keep searching or wait for a similar upcoming product to come out
Nice camera
This is a very nice camera
I like the fact that it's a 30x zoom-yet is pocket-sized
I have a 50x zoom camera also-but I tend to use this one most of the time-because I can stick it in my purse or pocket-which I can't do with my other one
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars-is because it doesn't have an automatic flash
It does however tell you when you should pop the flash up
All things considered I would definitely recommend this camera
6 SHOTS w DIFFERENT EFFECTS w 1 push of the shutter release
After owning Canons and Nikons I tried this one because of the 30 X ZOOM and am VERY PLEASED
YOU CAN BE a artistic pro with the CREATIVE SHOT option which with 1 push of the shutter button gives you 6 different shots, with different effects, and different crops and zooms
All of the shots are very awesome
Great camera
Great camera
Even with the max zoom the pictures turn out great
Fantastic so far
This is only the first day of using the sx700 but it's performance has been impressive
In auto mode, the image quality is great even though it is apparently capped off at Fine (the camera can take pictures with Superfine quality in other modes)
The 30x optical zoom (with digital extension up to 120x) is astonishing
Even at 120x, I see very little grain and surprisingly little chromatic distortion
The image stabilization is excellent
Low light performance seems quite good
I would be the first to say, "Canon has done it again," were I not also an owner of the ill-fated sx280
I had purchased the sx280 for a family member to use on a trip to Europe
The camera  failed in ways that have been documented about the 280 elsewhere (see Amazon reviews and the Canon forums)
My experience with the 280 really shook my faith in Canon but I decided to take a chance with the sx700 in hopes of getting essentially a 280 that worked
The good news is that sx700 appears to be what the 280 was supposed to be and more, with better quality and no evidence of the same video/auto shut off problems that plagued the 280
I'm hopefully optimistic
recurring problem with battery
While I like the camera very much, it still has the problem of the battery blinking during video taking
I can still continue video but am not sure how long I have
After several clips I check the battery status and it shows almost full
There's much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom, quick and accurate focus, true HD video, relatively good build quality
I concur with the majority of the pros I've seen in other reviews, but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers:- TOKEN GRIP: While I'm sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors, it's still hardly a grip
I've come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist
In efforts to make the camera as small as possible, Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case
Flash is not this camera's strong suit in any case
I have noticed fewer problems after shooting with the camera for several days, but remain leery
- MANUAL FLASH SELECTION: Not only must you pop up the flash manually, but it's a tiny, inconvenient switch on the side where your hand will never naturally land
I have lost more than a few shots fumbling to get the darn thing open
- BATTERY LIFE: It's relatively, well, miserable
I have yet to swap in the 1700 mAh spares I purchased, but hope they add a few exposures to what the supplied battery can provide
- OVERLY AGRESSIVE NOISE REDUCTION: I'd much rather do the retouching on my computer and be selective about how much to apply, and where
Sometimes detail with noise is more palatable than loss of detail and less noise
None of these is a show-stopper for me, and there is indeed a lot to like, but I can't call this the best camera ever made
My A650 takes better pictures a significant percentage of the time and will continue to be in my camera bag until it eventually gives up the ghost
On the other hand, I took a video of approximately 8 minutes in duration with the Vivitar 1700 mAh batteries without seeing a low battery warning, although the camera got pretty hot in the process
I highly recommending getting at least one on the Vivitars as a spare if you're planning to be away from your charger with this camera for any length of time
Feature packed lightweight camera
Pictures are great the rapidfire feature is very good
Finding your target in the zoom mode is a little difficult, and takes some getting used to, camera shake can cause some problems, but overall it is an excellent camera
It is compact and lightweight which makes a great take on trips
Otherwise fantastic camera
3rd Canon SX series with lens or lens cover hang ups
Otherwise fantastic camera
Canon -- by far the best camera made at all levels
This is a perfect high pixel camera with telephoto lens for travel
Don't get me wrong I love my Pro Canon EOS camera but this one is very easy to carry, up to date on technology, links to my phone, it's just a perfect all around point and shoot digital with enough manual options to make this semi pro photographer happy
Great camera
I love this new camera and just started to use it when we went to our niece's wedding in Chicago
It took great photographs
Awesome little camera that takes great pics
Great picks, hard to up load
I was not able to get the pictures uploaded to my computer the process was very difficult
Best Compact Cameras for zoom
I like the Powerful 30x Optical Zoom in this camera
And 120x digital zoom
I like the WiFi remote control in this camera
I can share images and video easily to my phone
I liked the weight of the camera and easy to carry with me
Awesome 30X optical zoom, fast processing and lots of features
I was looking to replace my old Canon Powershot that's an ultracompact
While the size made it super portable, I needed something with more zoom capability and a better lens for low light conditions
I was willing to sacrifice some additional weight and size to get that
Don't get me wrong--this is no high end DSLR camera
I have a Nikon D90 for taking exceptional photos and that will be the camera I always go to for professional results
I wanted something far more portable that did not require a camera bag when traveling, biking and hiking
Low light photos look really good so far, but I need to experiment more
The camera has a solid feel to it
Definitely weighs more than my ultracompact, but I knew that going into this class of camera
There are numerous features and the menu system can be a little daunting, but I tend not to get carried away with all of those special scene features
Although the ability for the camera to take a picture based on the introduction of a face, a face smiling or winking is pretty slick
LCD screen is beautiful and high resolution
I’ve even linked it to my iPhone5 over Wi-Fi and like the ability to transfer pictures so that I can post some immediately on Flickr or Facebook
I have not taken many videos yet, but it looks nice so far
I do like the ability of having a separate button for videos in addition to the normal shutter release
Very handy when you just want to take a quick video without having to switch modes on the camera
However, the manual says you cannot change the zoom while taking video, so I want to verify that and make sure the focus keeps up
Also keep these few things in mind based on the questions I've seen here on Amazon so far
No memory card is provided
Most digital cameras for years do not include one as the options are huge and each person has their own needs on how much storage they need (and they're cheap)
If you're looking for a good case, the Case Logic QBP-202 is a perfect fit (still allows you to store a small cable and some SD cards if needed)
Super handy and great quality
Beautiful image stabilization, especially at 30x without tripod or mono
Only problem - wireless syncing with computer and smartphone for remote shooting
How is it possible to build such a technological masterpiece and sell it for such a low price
For the price, could have included an SD card and instruction manual
Great for zoom
Was looking for a small camera with a great zoom and this is it
We go riding in the desert in a side by side and this is perfect for that - small and stowable, but takes wonderful distance shots of the beautiful desert vistas
Review of the Canon SX700 with comparison to the older sx280
The Canon sx superzoom series of digital cameras have consistently delivered terrific image quality in good lighting in a pocket sized camera
The SX700 has an incredible 30x optical zoom ranging from true wide angle at 25mm (full frame equiv)  to 750mm telephoto (full frame equiv)
Photos taken in daylight or bright indoor lighting display vibrant color and are very sharp
Photos taken in dim lighting requiring an ISO setting of 800 (or higher) are not very good
The built in flash appears to be movable to simulate a 'bounce flash'
Unfortunately, the flash head can not be turned upward which is a shame
The built in flash on this camera (like almost all built in flashes) is harsh distributing light unevenly
In bright indoor lighting, it may be  better to use aperture priority mode, choose the largest aperture available (3
2 at the widest end)  and shooting without any flash
Although the SX700 is a pocket camera, it is a little bigger than most small cameras including previous models (i
the sx280)
The mode dial (PASM) is tight requiring an unusual amount of force for this type of dial
I do not know if this just affects my sample
The camera has very good image stabilization which is essential for shooting at slower shutter speeds especially at longer telephoto settings
Comparing this camera to the older SX280, both cameras rendered very similar (punchy) photos in good lighting
you will be very pleased with the images
If you shoot in dim lighting you may wish to consider something with a bigger sensor, faster maximum aperture and/or a hot shoe for an external flash
If you do not really need all that zoom, the sx280 may be a better way to go
The images are a little better, the camera is smaller, cheaper and a 20x zoom is still more than most people will ever need
Another excellent (and cheaper) alternative is the Samsung WB350 (I have reviewed that camera too on Amazon)
Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer
Upgrade From Canon SX280; Very Effective Image Stabilization
The 20X zoom on the SX280 was good, the 30X on the SX700 is even better and gives me better photos of distant objects
With the SX700, I am getting very good photos and video, it is always ready to shoot both close ups and distant object, no lens change necessary, and it is light weight and easy to carry
The best camera, of course, is the one you have with you
Given the quality of the photos and video I am shooting with the SX700, the effectiveness of the image stabilization, and the camera's portability, I don't hesitate to take the SX700 when going out for the day or traveling
Whenever I leave the house, it is in is case on my belt, ready for use
I would like to say a little more about the image stabilization
However, with the SX700 there is no choice, you must use the screen
So I hold the camera in both hands, raise my hands and bend my elbows and look at the screen to line up my shot
I can see the screen fine, but I can also see that the camera is not being held rock steady
However, when I look at the resulting shot, even those taken with the lens fully zoomed out, I see no evidence of the camera shake that I know existed
Really amazing, my expensive 60D doesn't do any better even though I am using the viewfinder and holding the camera steady against my head
The best compact zoom camera
This is the best camera in its class, that is, the best compact zoom
However, if you're looking for the best camera to take to a concert for example, this is it
I've been using the predecessors to this camera (the 260SX - 280SX) and this has one of the biggest bumps in performance and quality
Poor Design Choices
Poor design decisions (probably some poor marketing influence, too):1
Design choice of rechargeable battery pack rather than 2 AA lithium ion batteries; pack can not deliver full day of pictures; for whole day, one needs at least one extra battery pack, at $60 each
No optical view finder; pictures must be framed via LCD monitor, which is extremely difficult in daylight with sun behind you
Also, use of monitor increases rate of battery pack depletion
To date, I have been unable to use the Wi-Fi feature to download to Mac computers and into iPhoto
I do not want to be confined to Canon software to annotate, organize, and store my photos and download via Wi-Fi
Very good camera for casual shooting
This camera fits perfectly between my Rebel XT DSLR, which takes excellent pictures but is bulky (especially with all the lenses) and a small and light ELPH 100HS point and shoot
Its a bit large and heavy for a point and shoot, but it still fits my pants pocket
It feels very solid
What I especially liked:-The picture quality in general-The 30X zoom has surprisingly low chromatic aberration
What I was not crazy about:-The GPS tagging is mostly a gimmick; it actually depends on an app on your phone, which records GPS position and date/time
The app then connects to the phone and applies the tag based on date/time
The big problem is that the app drains the battery of my Samsung S3 Mini in a few hours
-Battery life: I wouldn't call it miserable like other reviewers, but it doesn't last a long day; I suggest you to buy a spare
Its very expensive from Canon ($35+), I have a cheap knock-off that lasts almost as long and cost $6
-The flash assembly seems frail I am very happy with this camera and I highly recommend it
I hope Canon fixes the GPS tagging app so it uses less battery on the phone
Camera for Cabo
A great camera
I was also able to get wonderful short 30 second videos of the wedding ceremony
I took over 400 pictures at the wedding and I cannot say enough good things about this camera
So Far The Best Pictures but Still Somewhat Weak In Low Light
I dropped my Canon Powershot S80 & got this to replace it
I was looking for the widest (24-25 mm) with good zoom in a compact camera
I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera
)Note:  I first tried the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19
Although it has a lot of neat features, it didn't deliver on true color quality, especially indoors, moving or fairly still pets, or outdoors in my rose garden (which was surprising, since it did much better on closeups of the roses)
Also the exposure looks fine on the screen but when seen on viewer/computer, it's a bit too dark
The color is slight-moderately better & resolution much better/clearer than Sony Cyber-shot
Low light is still a bit of a problem
The "low light" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light
I do miss having a panorama option, but I find I tend to do a movie in those cases anyway
The camera body is solid/well constructed, grip is ok, a bit stingy on the left side (but I have small hands so not a deal breaker), & yes, the dial is stiff but doable
Unfortunately the video mike isn't that great, can't pick up cat purring unless right on top of camera & lots of background noise
Overall, though, has the best pictures so far in a compact camera with good zoom as of May 2014
Canon take note:  I'd love a camera with Less options for those of us who just want to stick mostly to Auto but better low light photos & a panorama option
This camera is extremely versatile and easy to lug around
I could not be more pleased
The SX700 is a nice, full-featured but not-too-expensive, 2nd camera for this enthusiast
And going with a higher end G series would defeat the purpose of "cheaper and lighter"
Solid build like a mini-SLR
The dial is stiff and clicks into place (but doesn't lock into place)
Multi-mode IS does well for low-light (less shake in the results)* Good results (in auto or "P" modes) with high-contrast shots like shooting directly into sunlight
Sharp results against complex landscapes
At the wide-angle end, the optics are unflattering for portraits (more than SLR wide-angles)
Reasonably good coverage, though direct flash is never flattering for anything other than fill-flash
Lots of modes and features, I've barely explored some of them
Like other recent cams, there's face-tracking to try to get snapshots "right" on the first try
Heavy emphasis on connectivity options using wireless, canon online services, NFC, direct print to canon printers
First, the still photos are extremely high quality
I use it mostly on Auto and it works extremely well
But the best part is the video
The only slight compromise is that the video steady shot feature is not quite as good as you would find on a high end consumer video camera
But this is not much of a factor unless really zoomed
You pay for what you get, and this pocket size camera is worth every penny
Super Travel Camera for Long-Distance
This camera is a must-have for long-distance zoom power, ease of use, and quality of pictures
Excellent picture quality
Zoom works really well, better than expected
Stabilization program very effective
Menu is not all that intuitive
Battery life = about a day's worth of off and on use while on a recent vacation
Easily fits in pants pocket
Great quality
My husband, the photographer, is enjoying learning how to use this camera after having used Panasonic cameras through the years
The print quality with the zoom is quite good
Although not as small as the cameras he is used to, it fits nicely in a pocket
No Wi-Fi
Great pictures just forget the Wi Fi
For the recent few years Canon has made great efforts to improve their travel-zoom compact cameras, and the new SX700 is their next remarkable achievement on that way
It's a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one)
It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient, even when shooting video, since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera
A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body
Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video
Zoom Framing Assist - very useful new feature to compose your pictures at long telephoto
Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills
5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies
New 16MP high-resolution, high-speed CMOS Sensor
The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm
Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes
Full HD 1920 x 1080, 60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format
Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded
A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording, now on the top of the camera
A new high-resolution 922K, 3" display
WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet
* Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag
* Almost the same battery (NB-6LH) as for SX280 (NB-6L) - old one works fine
Slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor SX280
* A new Noise Reduction algorithm is more aggressive on low-contrast areas
I took many good pictures -  sharp and clean, with nice colors
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens with an Optical Image Stabilization, which spans an incredible 25-750mm equivalent range in a pocket-sized body, is a significant improvement over the SX280's 20x range
On the other hand, when wide-open, the new lens provides slightly better aperture
The new SX700 also introduces an interesting feature - Zoom Framing Assist, which should help with composing shots of far distant subjects
From the prospective of the image resolution, it is nice to step up from the prior 12 MP to the new 16 MP especially for landscape photos, what allows to present more fine details and to make your pictures to look more natural than before
Of course, packing more megapixels into the same sensor size causes less light to be collected by each pixel, but on the other hand, Canon stated this new one is a "High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor" and also a new noise-reduction algorithm works more effectively, so such a resolution leap should not cause any noticeable deterioration in IQ
So this new Canon camera is a very good compact device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording
Decent camera but I returned it
I bought this camera from another retailer because it was available before Amazon
Unfortunately I ended up sending it back
In good light, this camera takes very nice pictures
Use it in anything but good light and things go downhill with the overly aggressive noise reduction
This is especially evident when zoomed to it fullest reach in anything other than bright daylight
The lens simply can't get enough light at F6
Photos were less sharp in many cases compared to some of my other cameras, mostly due to the aggressive noise reduction
It was just too much for me to tolerate
I'm sure others will be perfectly happy with it but it's not the camera for me
I sent it back
Nice Camera
After a couple of weeks so far so good
Love the 30X zoom
Picture quality is great in good light
30X stabilization and pic quality are not perfect but pretty good
Need a tripod for that zoom level
Video quality is as good as I have seen for such a small device
The wi-fi and app are lame and all but useless
Buy some extra batteries
The Vivitar 1700 mAh work good but this thing eats batteries
Overall for it's size though it's tough to beat this
A fine light camera
I have been using a Canon EOS 7
It does very well with totally automatic as well with aperture and time control
The zoom is wonderful
It takes great pictures
It is light
Fast to set up
Very good with its focus
I will buy a mirror-less soon, but for the time being this is a great camera
It was time to upgrade our Canon 5MP camera so after reading a whole lot of reviews, I chose this one
We have had it only a few weeks and love it
Very easy to use and the preview screen is large
I haven't read all the instructions and have only used the automatic mode but we've been happy with the quality of the pictures
It is a little larger than our old SD700 IS but fits in the pocket and takes better night pictures
It takes great pictures and I love the 30x optical zoom
Defective video recording: uses too much battery
Excellent camera
Bought this camera about a month ago
Replacing a four year old Canon
Gave it five stars
Amazing camera and I've only scratched the surface of what it can do
All the different features are wonderful
Really like the different ways it can be used
You really have to check out the creative shot feature
Will take a shot of one view and convert it into five or six other versions
Super cool
Plus video is beautiful
Highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants a little extra with their camera
Worth every penny
Took it on a trip to Oregon and using it much
Recommend buying extra battery pack and extra SD cards
You will be getting good use from them with this camera
Get out and about and enjoy
Excellent camera
highly recommended
This is the lastest purchase for me in the PowerShot line of cameras
I pre-ordered and have found it to be just perfect
I am very pleased with the upgrades from my SX300HS
My wife and I each have carried our own 300HS for about two years
I added a 50SX about a year ago to have the larger 50 zoom
And now the SX700 with a 30 zoom
The 300HS is a basic auto camera that fits very nicely in my pants pocket
It goes everywhere and after two years is showing a little external wear
But the pictures are just as good as always
The form fit of the SX700 is a little bit bigger but offers some advance features that make the size increase very worthwhile
Best Camera I Ever Had
This is a replacement of my SX260
Really love it
Better image quality and fully fix the noise from SX260 video
Great skin color
I give it 4 stars only because the GPS function is missing
For my long overseas travel, the GPS function is actually essential
Very fast and great zoom
I love this camera
This is my 4th P&S in recent years and is the best
I have had Panasonic Lumix models and a Casio
It's a little larger than most models but it still is carried in my front jean pocket at all times
I always carry it in a protective hardcase
It feels and looks very solid and well built
It is very fast in writing, reading, shutter action, on and off, and preview of picture taken(Quick Option)
The 30 optical lens is awesome with an option of as high as 120 digital zoom
My only disappointment so far is that you cannot shoot super fine quality in the &#34;auto&#34; shooting function
That is available in &#34;P&#34;(program) mode
A little bigger and heavier than I expected
And the color of picture is not as beautiful as sony
Others are good
comparison between L830 and predecesor L820
Previously owned the predecesor L820 and like many say from first glance looks the same but there are multi different specs between these 2 so my review is related to their comparison
First the tilt able screen is an awesome new feature for those low to ground shots
Just tilt screen up to you and click
Perfect pic
Same for high over head pics
A really nice feature you don't take into consideration until you're in that predicament
Secondly is the amazing ability to take great low light pictures
Sure you have to keep super steady but i find that to be a huge advantage over the L820 which had not so great low light pics and suffered from blurriness
But over all I give this a definite 9/10
One point shy for not having rechargeable battery which isn't all that bad if you're traveling all you need is pop old ones amd replace a sinch
Daughter's First  Camera
This camera was purchased  for my  daughter for  fourteenth  birthday
She  has shown  interest in photography  and wanted her &#34;first real camera&#34;
She has been enjoying  the functional ease  of it  and the nice pictures  it takes
Camera looks nice  and the  zoom is  very nice
She took a picture  of a deer in the woods
Zoomed in to take a  nice still picture,  and the deer looks like it was standing right in front of her
picture clear
It was nice
Five Stars
Great purchase
I love it
Easy to Use
I've owned a few Nikons in the past, and am happy with this easy to use model at a pretty good price
Affordable and nice features
Nikon coolpix has some nice desired features and is easy to use
It is attractive and well designed
This camera takes series of photos and processes the best image
Result is vibrant picture
You can use built in differnt scenery mode or let camera decide it for you
What I didn't like about it is that it feels cheap and made of plastic material but Nikon may have done it to make it light in the weight
Flash and battery door pop up seems flimsy and I felt it won't last very many use or break off on slight mishandling
Camera doesn't have a view finder but it makes up with tilt swivel screen in many direction so you can take pictures pointing above your head (if you're in crowd or if bright Sun is blaring in the middle of the day then you can Change screen position up, down or in sides
Your photos would come out darker if you're zooming in far out subject on cloudy day but with 34x zoom you should be using a tripod and taking photo when there is suffrciant light behind you and onto the subject, camera does compensate for shake but that is more effective when you're taking a portrait but when you're zoning in 30 times even a slight hand shake will multiply 30 times
Great camera
This camera worked great on my recent trip to the Butchart gardens in Victoria
It fits comfortably in my hands, and it's easy to use
It's by no means an SLR with different adjustable lens attachments, so if you're looking for that kind of technicality, this isn't the one you want, but for the price, it's an all-around great camera
Best camera in it's price range
Rather than compare specifications, let me just say what I love about this camera
It has a very fast auto-focus
Way faster than either of my Panasonic Lumix cameras
I thought I might miss a digital viewfinder but discovered that, with the brightness turned up on the LCD, the viewfinder was quite useable in bright sunlight and the view is stunning in hi resolution
The dual controls for the telephoto are nicely placed and quite accessible
I also find using AA batteries easier and less expensive than proprietary batteries
I use alkaline and rechargeables and may use lithium in the future
The L830 can use all three types
This is a GREAT hybrid camera for the price
I really do like it
I needed a good camera to take photos of prom and other activities that my daughter has and this camera was truly great for that purpose
Every picture turned out clear and the zoom option was nice although I didn't need it to zoom that close
It takes good pictures, they aren't the great pictures you've seen by really expensive professional cameras but I really can't complain about the clarity of any of my pictures
They looked better than all of my friends pictures by far and they had way more expensive bulkier camera's than I did
So all in all I am very pleased
However, I really wished I would've done a little more research because I do keep in touch via social media with my family and this would have been a few steps easier to upload pictures had it had built in wifi like the Canon SX510
By all other reviews they rank these two camera's pretty close and that would've sent me the other way had I done my research better
I guess if wifi doesn't matter to you then this is your camera
Nice
Great camera no complaints
I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a simple camera
Get one today
Nikon Coolpix L830 - Great Camera for the Price
I like everything about this camera except one thing
if the lense is on or the batteries are low, the camera freezes and you have to turn it off and on
Besides that
you're not going to find a better camera for this price
Great birthday present
I bought this camera from my daughter for her birthday and she likes the one we have which is a slightly older model
She was thrilled
Awesome Camera
This is an awesome camera
The zoom capability is amazing
Can't wait to use it on our vacation and take just amazing pictures
This will help capture our memorable vacation forever
high quality camera
There are so many automatically correcting, errors features that it is well nigh impossible to NOT get a perfect photo
Except, of course, if you do not choose the perfect thing to photograph
The pictures are very sharp and the zoom is good
I miss having a grid,may be
A thrill to own
When I saw the ad I was thrilled as I had checked it out before going to Amazon
When it came I was petrified to start all the things I had to do to really make it mine
BUT it was easy as pie and I am snapping to my hearts content
lovely camera
love this camera
so easy to use, its very comfortable in the hand, it feels quite friendly if that makes any sense :P  The rubbery spots are very convenient for gripping it and taking pictures with one hand
I never use a flash, so the pop-up flash isn't really a bother
I was able to pull it out of the box and start taking pictures right away
The huge viewscreen tilts and swivels to make it easy to take a pic of something low to the ground (resulting in lots of right up in their faces cat pictures) and its big and bright
I'm very impressed with the quality of the images I've taken so far
Zoom is great, but be advised camera shake is multiplied when you have it on maximum zoom, so if you plan on taking lots of long distance shots I would invest in a tripod or monopod
I look forward to taking pictures from my window of deer and critters that wander into the far reaches of the yard
The macro is so much better than my old camera (a small digital point and shoot, its a trooper, but very basic) I tested it out on some earrings and was able to get very crisp extreme closeups, with little need for editing
it takes 4 regular 2AA batteries, which I like, as its quick and convenient, and I was able to pop in my old SD card and get to work taking photos
the red is gorgeous, which is a plus, a deep shimmery black cherry sort of color
only complaint-the neck strap is kind of narrow and uncomfortable, but that's an easy fix
Nice camera for the price
Great camera, upgraded from my Nikon Coolpix S8100 when it crapped out
Good telephoto and macro for internet,  and I am able to get photos of the dogs, so far I am very pleased
Nikon Camera
Excellent
Very happy with my purchase
Easy to operate and hold
Nice clear picture and great zoom capabilities
Would highly recommend getting one
Still learning
I spent a month looking at cameras, Nikon, Canon, Samsung and more, but after reading all the reviews and being completely confused, selected the L830 and am happy I did
Camera arrived day before H
S graduation, just enough time to learn the basics
So far I love the quality of the pictures
Looking forward to micro photos and other features
I do not like the position of the button to video
When I hold the camera, my thump seems to always touch that button, will have to work on different thumb placement
There is also to many settings and it is difficult to figure out the best one, if I want to try different settings, the subject has moved or the light is different by the time I scroll to the next one, that said, I do like everything so far and will continue to experiment with all the settings
Would recommend this camera
Ooops, I goofed
The camera is fine, but I ordered the wrong thing
I wanted to replace my Coolpix P100 that is a GREAT camera
After thousands of photos, it is ready for retirement
In looking at the specs on the L830, it looked like just the right thing to replace the P100
Unfortunately I thought it was a viewfinder camera and it is not
We took it on vacation and then found you have to look at the monitor on the back to frame the shot
Two problems
(1) my eyesight makes it difficult to manage
In particular in bright sunlight I could not see the picture well enough for precise cpmpositions
Flying bird photos just did not work well at all
(2) holding the camera still enough for low light photos at long telephoto settings was a problem
I guess after 65 years of using viewfinder cameras, I just did not adjust to having to look at the monitor
Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks
Very Amateur Photographer
My husband and I travel quite a bit
I wanted a camera I could be comfortable with, not spend too much time setting up my shots, and still get a great picture in the end
My last camera was a Canon power shot
After my grand daughter dropped and broke the lens and telescope, I put it away and just used my phone for the past year
We leave for my nieces wedding in Ireland in August
I want to make sure I get tons of great pictures
I want to take classes and become a better photographer
So based on the previous reviewers who give their pros and cons, thank you so much
I like the weight and feel of my camera
I like the ease of selecting the shooting mode, switching between the various menus, and the playback mode is similar to my old Canon
I also like the lens cover
It is like a little magnet gadget and has a tiny cord that holds the cap while it is off the lens
I lost so many lens caps in the past:{One tiny thing I am not crazy about: having to pop up the flash
I rather liked the old lazy way of the auto flash happening when I needed it
I am going to work on my picture taking skills, and report back to you after I know what I'm supposed to do with all these bells a whistles
Thank you
The zoom is fantastic
I bought the camera because of its zoom
I didn't want all the different lenses to mess with
It's a good camera for amatures
I think it will give me some great close up actions shots this summer on the lake
Good camera for the price
Excellent camera that takes high quality pictures quickly and easily
Not a professional photographer and wanted something easy to use and this fit the bill
great gift
my wife loves her camera - the pictures are of high quality and it was easy to use
This is a bit thicker than the other digital cameras, but we knew that going in
It fits in her purse and she loves the quality
Great camera
Others have written plenty about the pros and cons
The bulky size to accommodate the 4 AA batteries and lack of a viewfinder (a common complaint for most LCD cameras) cost this other great camera one star
Awesome Price for a Great Camera
First, let me say that I am not terribly techy
I can barely turn on the TV anymore
So please, read the specs on this because I can't explain what they mean anyway
This review is based solely on my experience with the camera
We took this great little camera on a trip to Mexico not long ago and it was awesome
So easy to use that even I managed to get some spectacular photos
My eyes are over 40 years old (the rest of me feels 29) so I have some trouble seeing up close
Therefore, the pictures I took with this camera were kind of just point, shoot and pray
Well the prayers were answered because when we looked at the pictures later on a screen I could actually see, they turned out super crisp
In fact there was a topless sunbather in one that I hadn't seen and my son was delighted that I got such a sharp, focused shot
The HD video is also super cool
My son is using it to launch his youtube career -- he really needs to focus on college
-- lousy content aside, the videos turn out great
I haven't used it for video, but he does and loves it
This camera is really sturdy and well made
It bounced around in my bag, got knocked off the table a time or two, and overall wasn't treated as well as it should have been
It didn't miss a beat or even get a scratch
The zoom is amazing
The display is great (or so I am told since I can't really see it)
This is an all around great addition to the amateur photographer or as a basic family camera
Highly recommend
Great Camera For the Money
Excellent
Very happy with it
Not having a view finder sucks, but I shoot with a nice Nikon and that's all I use
Took it out for a test shoot today
Not bad at all
Not even close to a D3, but I wanted a camera to leave in the car all the time
Got it for about $200, and I won't stay awake at night about it being in the car
First Rule in a Gun Fight, Have One
First Rule taking photos With A Camera, Have One
Great purchase
I'm very pleased with this camera
It takes great pictures and is simple to use
I was just looking for a camera to take decent pics of the kids, and I wanted to stay within the $300 range
I gave four stars rather than five because I would have preferred a rechargeable battery
However, I've used this camera on a family vac and really have no complaints about using batteries
Error message of "this card cannot be read"
The camera would work with internal memory - but would not work with a memory card of any sort or size installed
It also rendered the camera entirely useless due to the inability to even sort through the functions of the camera to try and format the memory card while inserted in camera
Donation
I bought this camera to donate for a raffle to raise money for life
My bff got this as a christmas gift and rated it very high
Awesome
I wanted a camera that was easy to use - no swapping out lenses or tricky settings
This one is perfect
Takes beautiful pictures
I suggest reading the manual and learning as much as you can about the settings it does have
Movies, panoramic shots, close-ups and portraits are all wonderful
I highly recommend this product (my mom and my sister both bought one)
Five Stars
Well satisfied
I quite like the product
did not give it 5 stars because it does not include case
It is a product that meets specifications if Information
Professional quality pictures by an inexperienced photographer
I used this camera on my vacation to Costa Rica
It took amazing pictures
My still pictures of hummingbirds are praised by all who see them
I had some difficulty with the panoramic pictures
I believe that was due to my inexperience with the camera
For someone who doesn't need professional pictures, this is a wonderful camera
I highly recommend this camera
Just what I was looking for
I was looking to replace my aging Kodak and decided on this camera after months of searching and reading online reviews
I plan on taking it on vacation so I will run it through the gauntlet then
So far it is doing exactly as advertised
Pros: Battery life seems fair, makes excellent pictures and is very user friendly
I started using it straight out of the box without having to read a book of instructions
It makes great low-light pictures, something that my old camera wasn't doing
Uses real batteries
Zoom brings the subject right to you
Cons: Action shots are blurry even with stable hands, no view finder
Doesn't feel real sturdy so I am still taking my older indestructible Kodak camera along in the rough places we ride which kind of defeats the purpose of replacing it
Great Camera at this price point
we purchased this camera when we took a trip to Alaska
I knew that the scenery there would be more than I imagined
So, I researched several cameras and this had the price that I needed on my budget but also have nearly as much total zoom as those competing cameras had at twice the price
I was not disappointed
I took about 1200 photos on that trip without a hitch
Everyone loved those pictures and we were able to see things from a Cruise ship that we would have never seen otherwise
Battery life was good, and picture quality was great
If I had known more about photography and could have set if for manual settings, I might have done some better, but overall quality of the pictures was amazing
Five Stars
For the price is an extremely great camera
Great camera for the money
This is a great camera
It takes awesome still shots
I haven't figured out how to take good action photos though
They turn out blurry
The instructions that come with it are very basic
It doesn't give any info as to what the different scenes should be used for
Perhaps I just need to go online and find more detailed descriptions
The zoom on it is great and zooms in very clear
For under $200, I think it's a great value
Not a great camera for action or concerts
First let me say that I was impressed by all of the features listed
However the users manual is practically worthless
Most of the icons in the manual as well as on the camera are meaningless?
Things like the drumset will be in focus but anything moving like the drummer will be blurred
I'm sending this back
Just what  wanted
This is a cool camera
Works perfect as you ould expect
Does lots and has great zoom
battery seems to last long so far
Excellent camera
I t has the perfect size and
Excellent camera
I t has the perfect size and all the functions for a family camera, and in a affordable price
Great Camera
Purchased this camera to take pictures and video of my son graduating boot camp
I knew we would not be close so the high power zoom is what made me choose this model
It was great, got some wonderful pictures on the oppisite side of the parade grounds
The video's turned out good also
The only near negative is that the view screen is hard to see in bright sun while doing video
Five Stars
I love it
Grear
The camera does all I need and wanted
Disappointing
When the camera works the pictures are beautiful and the camera is easy to use as well
A couple of times I was able to restart it and it would work but now it has died a second time
Nothing works
I guess I got a dud but I am majorly disappointed in Nikon
When I called in I was told to take the batteries and sd card out and replace them
Then turn it on and press the 'menu' button
The tech seem surprised when I told her nothing happened
Oh well
It seems I spent a good deal of money for a part-time camera
Most disappointed
easy to/ use
I am not a great or even good photographer, but part of my job involves taking photos and incorporating them into my journals
The zoom on this camera is amazing, the pictures I take using the 34x zoom are clear and crisp
I haven't had the camera for a very long so I am still learning about it, but the camera is easy to use and takes great pictures, which is what I bought the camera for
Best camera ever
I wanted something a little more sophisticated than a point and shoot and this camera is terrific
It is easy to use, easy to hold and the moveable viewfinder is great
Great camera
This is a great camera
It shoots nice pictures
The auto mode works in most cases
If you play around with the settings a little bit you find out what works best
We were at the Niagara Falls and even the evening pictures of the Falls turned out great, I was surprised
I love that you can tilt the screen, it came in handy so many times
The battery life is good too
Oh, and the zoom is beyond awesome, love it
All in all I am very satisfied
Great so far
I have just played with it, learning to use it, so far it has been great, suggest a tripod for the extra long zoom shots
Terrific little camera
I doubt there is a better camera for the money
I have had full size dslr and slr Nikons all my life
Never a problem and they all produce excellent pictures
I no longer take pictures professionally, so I looked into a light weight camera that at least had most of the bells and whistles
This one fits the bill beautifully
My only complaint would be no viewfinder
Very hard to see the picture in bright sunlight
Five Stars
Nice camera, very simply to use
Just get familiar with the menu and settings
Pictures are great
Coolpix L830 camera
Unit arrived overnight which was nice
I saw my 10-year old bury his head in the manual for a moment or two & proceed to snap off a few zoomed frames overlooking the peninsula
What I saw were very clear/crisp photos which appeared to be somewhat on par with my Panasonic FZ70
In a nutshell, if you are intent on increasing your range & don't overly care to concern yourself w/manual settings, as well as comparing the intuitive interface, the tilting LCD screen, and most of all, the image quality to the Canon SX510 & other megazooms, I am rather confident believing there is no better camera out there anywhere at this $196 price point
No doubt a great value
First digital camera
This is my first digital camera and I think its awesome
I have been taking a lot of nice pictures and I'm improving every time
It is very easy to use and has a good zoom on it
the only thin I wish was different would be a battery pack instead of 4 AA batteries
(always keep an extra set
Nikon Coolpix L830 Diugital Camera
When using zoom it doesn't take clear pics right off
Most of them are blurry
Video clips don't always load to my media player
I am still learning how to use it so I will have to give it a little more time
Overall I think ii is a fine camera
Love It
Excellent camera
I has a Cannon One Shot prior to the Coolpix that got stolen
I went with the Nikon and couldn't be happier
It takes great shots and the flexible viewfinder display is great for taking picture's in a crowd
Nice
Love this camera
Bought it for a trip to Alaska and the pictures turned out amazing
I am not a photographer so the point and shoot works great for me
I would like to see future models have WIFI and viewer for your eye
Perfect camera, feels good and sturdy, takes excellent pictures
WOW
Best camera I have owned in a decade
The zoom is incredible, crisp clear images
Excellent purchase
I totally love the screen versatility
Very nice but with common problem of LED/LCD screens
Very nice camera, only problem is a common problem with all cameras that use only a monitor screen and no viewfinder is that they are very difficult to see on a sunny day
I love the tilt-able/extendable screen for shooting overhead or waist high photos
The owners manual is way too brief and doesn't give enough details on how to use all the features or easy ways to access them
A great little camera, but I returned for a Panasonic w/ viewfinder
I loved the size, and feel of this Nikon
The zoom was great, the pictures sharp and the price, very good
And, I liked the Nikon's tilted screen
However, this was my first camera without a viewfinder, and after two weeks, I returned it and ordered the Panasonic Lumix FZ60 - a more expensive camera; but, with viewfinder
I really prefer having the  option of having both
The majority of my pictures are nature - birds, flowers, scenery
I had issues with seeing the screen in bright light and it's easier for me the zero in on the subject faster with the viewfinder
It is also easier for me to hold my camera steady when using the viewfinder
The panasonic does not have as long a zoom, but it serves my purpose and cropping  the final picture brings my subjects in beautifully
The Panasonic pictures are awesome, it's easy to use and has some great editing features
Bottom line, manufactures are missing the boat by not having more options with optic viewfinders  in their comoact models
Excellent
I love this camera
I had a Canon Coolpix, but this is a new and upgraded version
Love both cameras
The last camera I had was left in an airport in Portugal and not recovered
I know whoever has this one is pleased with it
I am very pleased with the COOLPIX L830
It is easy to use
I am older and cannot use anything complicated and I find that this meets all my needs and is easy to understand
The pictures are great
The color is always perfect
Love love this camera
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera that is simple to use
It is a lot better the the previous camera that I bought and sent back to Amazon
This camera has all of the features that I was looking for
however, it is an older version
I wish I had researched a bit more to get the latest, but I had to have a replacement camera quickly
Works Great
The camera was just what I was looking for
The 34x Zoom works great, and is very to  operate
Thanks
Great Deal Great Camera
I just got my new camera, I am not a expert in the matter, but I am VERY HAPPY  with this Nikon camera
The zoom is great, very simple option menu, great portability, come with a manual
I recommend this product 100%
Excelent price,
good enough
I looked at the P530 and L830, and Canon SX510
actually, I like the L830 more
its size is smaller and good for travel
looks more sturdy and easy to hold on hand than SX519
Awesome camera
It replaces another Nikon camera that I dropped
I like this one much better
The zoom is great, the pictures are awesome
Definitely recommend
NIKON COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera
Because of my incredible busy lifestyle, I have not used it a tremendous amount of time
However, so far I am very happy using the new camera
I will go on vacation in July andwill do my &#34;homework&#34; before - I promise

Awesome Camera
Awesome camara, and looks cute too
Just shoot and click
Small enough to put in your handbag and works like a professional camera
Love it
A horse and buggy it's not
This camera far exceeds my expectations
The last digital camera I purchased was 10 years ago
That camera is a horsew and buggy compared this one
I find it easy to use, the pictures excellent
Love This Camera
I love this camera
This is the best camera I have ever owned
That is quite a claim, but I be leave it's true
The pictures are unbelievable and the videos are great
The camera is small, light weight and easy to handle, and fits well into my hand
As to the dreaded lens error message, you must get into the habit of removing the lens cover before turning the camera on
After owning this camera for a month and have taken hundreds of pictures and many movies I can say its a great camera for under $200
Easy to use
Five Stars
Wonderful camera
Easy to use
Five Stars
Great camera-just what I was looking for and at a great price
New Camera
I haven't actually used it yet, but it's a Nikon, need I say more? Love the red color and the size
But I am sure I will love using it
Great little camera
I really like this camera - for the price it's a good value
I have just started using it and so far, it is very user friendly
The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a viewfinder, which I don't remember seeing in the description at all
Other than that, it takes great photos and is easy to use
Five Stars
Having fun with this camera
Takes great pictures -- I just need to learn and practice more
LOVE IT
This camera is everything I wanted
I wanted a simple but good quality picture taking camera
I needed something less complicated than what I had before so this is amazing for me
Love it
This camera is the best I've ever owned
The flip out adjustable screen makes it easy to keep steady for zoom shots
Great videos
It has a lot of options for photos
Nice
This is a great product for the money, I needed an upgrade from my compact camera and this is pretty, lightweight and takes great pics
As a realtor I was having trouble getting good photos of small rooms and this camera has made things those photos much easier to take
I don't mind the fact that it doesn't have a view finder seeing as I haven't used one in many years
so you can hear the stereo sound better
Volume could be loader, so you can hear the stereo sound better
What a surprise
I had been using an SLR from a competitor, and decided that it was too much for me to learn
Basically, I downgraded to a point and shoot with a super zoom 3 years ago
Noisy and grainy
Colors were all off
I decided to go with Nikon as a last resort of ever finding a decent camera at a decent price which someone of decent intelligence could operate
I FOUND IT
I LOVE the Nikon Coolpix L830
In the stores it was $299, on sale for $249
Found it on Amazon for $199 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping
SOLD
Put the batteries that came with it in, and shot a T ball game, senior pictures for a friend, and went to a local botanical garden since I received it on Thursday, and still has plenty of juice left
Zoom is awesome
Close up is awesome
Not too hard to steady with image stabilization, but with practice I will get even better
I can also take multiple pictures in rapid succession
Colors are good and images are SHARP
The tilt out screen is a nice feature that I did not know I wanted until I had it
I like the feel of this little camera, sturdy not plastic
I don't miss not having a viewfinder, which I thought I would
I will make sure and purchase a screen protector for the LCD
Have not tried video
A+ and I am telling everyone who wants a nice compact camera to shoot almost anything for a reasonable price
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
It doesn't explain the different modes at
I have never had a Coolpix before, so I'm in the early learning stages with it
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
It doesn't explain the different modes at all, and gives no tips on getting good shots
To get more detailed instructions I'm going to try the Nikon website
I do like the tilting view screen, though, which is something I've never seen before
Great pics and easy to use
Takes great pictures
Very easy to use
Long battery life for still shots, short battery life for video
Does not come with an SD card, so you'll need to purchase one
Good Camera
Love the tilting screen and the pic quality is very nice
My wife loves the camera, it is a bit tricky with the flash but you can get use to it
Great zoom camera
Great buy
I was looking to buy a mid price all purpose zoom camera
I was going to buy a Nikon s820
I noted that the s830 was better rated on Amazon
So we bought the s830
We have had very good luck taking indoor pics in an auditorium
Zoom works great, and pics are clear and vivid
The indoor pics are not dark
stabilization works great to reduce blur
Some notes- get the class10 memory card
Also stock up on GOOD rechargeable batteries such Duracell
I have ac delco batts in the camera now
They are working fine, but Duracells seem to be more predictable
Don't use alkaline batteries
They won't last
pocket chainsaw
great tool
still waiting for coupon for 99% off second one
I wish I could have gotten both at the same time
Great camera
It's a great step up from you basic point and shoot and from the L820 that we had purchased earlier
We stayed with Nikon because of past cameras
Both of our point and shoots suffered from being dropped and broken battery doors
Cameras worked fine but you had to hold the battery door shut
Both the 820 and the 830 came with neck straps so hopefully they'll fare better
The zoom feature works great, the macro mode is great, the low light function works great (you probably will need the flash only in a dark room)
Wonderful first camera or as a step up without spending big bucks
I Love My Nikon
Love the T/W lens, the scene choices, etc
The tilt screen is great, it allows this senior to get shots that would be difficult otherwise
I had considered a D-SLR, however this camera is all I need, and then some
great camera for the price
really nice for wide angle photos, which is why I bought it
Owner's manual not very good, online very complex yet doesn't explain things very well
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
I'm new at photography, but this camera is so easy to operate
My camera focus's by itself
All I have to do is point the camera at the picture I want and click
Beautiful picture
Best camera I've ever owned
I have been taking the best pictures EVER since I got this camera
Tonight was the best of all - took a picture of the moon - you can see craters CLEARLY in the photo
Amazing quality and so easy to use
Not much of a learning curve at all for me, because I had a different Coolpix prior to this so it's similar
When I share pics with my friends on Facebook they always want to know what kind of camera I used
So depressed but then
I just had this beautiful camera delivered tonight
I was so excited and it doesn't work
I got the "Battery Exhausted" message with the batteries it came with so in my excitement, I ran to Target to buy 2 packs of Energizer Lithium batteries, a case and a memory card
This camera has all those bells and whistles that I wanted in a camera and so easy to use
You can adjust the exposure or just switch it to the exact type of setting you're in, like at a sporting event, or taking a picture of a pet, it's really easy and it takes great pictures
Good camera for the non-professional
The L830 meets my needs
We live in a rural area with lots of flowers and critters, and they are usually my subjects (unless our granddaughter is around)
My only disappointment is that it takes more time to focus when using the zoom than I would have thought
Still, I'm happy with my purchase and hope to get good use out of the camera
The macro shots are great
Caught a gregarious hummingbird in flight this week
Nikon L830 Great Camera
No Zoom Noise whilre Recording Video, Fantastic Purchase
Better on sale
Nikon L830 DOES NOT HAVE ANY ZOOM NOISE WHILE FILMING A VIDEO
It's easy to use in auto mode or has plenty of settings for the novis/hobbist that doesn't want to invest a couple of grand in lense's and bodies
My fujifilm S8200 had terrible zoom noise
That's why I took it back
This camera has far superior clarity in still pictures compared to the Fujifilm S8200 and when filming in HD, this camera has no interlacing issues when moving the camera like the Fujifilm S8200
I like the ability of just buying AA batteries and not being tied down to a lithium battery pack
I like the RED body although it shows fingerprints more than a black camera
no biggies
I've never used a View FInder so I don't miss that
I am on the fence about the settings buttons and not having a rotating selector switch
I do like having the saturation button at my fintertips though so maybe i'm really not on the fence
I do have only 1 issue
On my old Fujifilm S700, the flash auto popped up when needed
The L830 has to be manually released to function, but knowing that
I just release it most of the time
MSRP was $299, Sale was $269 and Got it from Walmart for $229, I think she quoted me the wrong price over the phone and had to get a manager override to give me the quoted $229
I'm using a 32Gig Class 10 SanDisk HC Ultra Memory card from Best Buy for $24 and it will allow me to take over 3000 photos
I think I should have went with a 8Gig SanDisk Ultra PLUS  that had a faster transfer rate
I think I'd do more research on the SDHC Cards before I buy one
Easy to Use and awesome close-ups
I was looking for new camera that took nice close-ups of family as well as my crafts
I was also looking for a camera to take non-flash pictures at events such as communions and dance recitals
I have to say this camera has performed way beyond my expectations
The resolution of the close-ups is fantastic and the zoom, non-flash shots are also fabulous
a great decision and purchase all the way around
Oh and I love the deep red color
I know exactly which camera is mine in the group on the table
What is the difference between this expensive Nikon and $5 Kodak digitial
camera readily available from local pawn shop?Unlike 30 year old Kodak, this Nikon junk probably leaks oil, but sensor is so tiny, hardly any oil lands in the sensor area
How does one know camera leaks oil?  The rotten scent emitted from oil in the chamber produces unique stinky scent, which is undeniably Nikon
WORKS LIKE A CHARM
I wanted a new camera, but I didn't want to spend too much money on it
The Nikon COOLPIX L830 was my choice
It is such an upgrade from my previous camera
I am having fun zooming in on very small images from across the room
This camera is working like a charm
I'm glad I bought it
Perfect for outdoors
I wanted something to be not to small nor too big, and I think this camera is just what I was looking for
And well is a Nikon, the shots are extremely crisp and clear, very easy to use, specially in the auto mode
The zoom? WOW I was really impressed
I can zoom in all the way and still capture a clear crisp shot of it
takes good pictures
I would have given it 5 stars except for pictures taken of small children or animals
Just isn't fast enough and I always get a blur
It has a great zoom as long as there is not fast movement
But a good camera for the price
I guess I just need to spend more money if I want a camera that will take pictures of fast movement
They absolutely love it
This was purchased as a gift
They absolutely love it
Five Stars
Excellent
Fantastic Purchase
I have used this camera for both photos and video recording
The results are exceptional, the videos are super clear and the audio is great
Photos are also beautiful
I have no regrets with this purchase
I haven't tried editing videos as yet, so I cannot comment on that, but so far so good
Beware of battery life
The battery life is not very good
I keep having to put in new batteries every time I turn around to use it
Since April, I've replaced them three times
The camera overall is great in the fact you don't need different zoom lenses and it works much like the small camera versions only with a little more bells and whistles
For a non-professional it's ideal
Nice
I love this camera
; love the color
However, it does not have rechargable batteries which is a big must for me
Excellent Product strongly suggested

Really great camera
Zoom is awesome
Really great camera
Zoom is awesome, shoots well in low light and movies are good for close-range
Only thing I'm not crazy about is having to replace batteries
That being said, they do last a long time but be sure to keep some spares
Five Stars
Great point-and-shoot with simple to use options
Great Little Camera
Compact, great features, and takes very sharp, excellent photos
I am very please with my purchase of the Nikon COOLPIX L830
Nikon COOLPIX L830
For years I only used my pocket Sony Cyber - shot
It was time to upgrade
I love using the L830 its easy and I enjoy using the built in effects
The zoom is spectacular
I'm taking pictures like a pro these days
If only it could fit in my pocket
I recommend this camera to anyone
Three Stars
picture were out of focus all the time; had to return it
Killer Camera with Amazing Battery Life
I can't say enough about this camera
I've seen much more expensive cameras that deliver a fraction of this camera's abilities and aren't as easy to use
I think the one most important issue I've noticed is for all its power, the batteries seem to last forever
I've had similar cameras and for the amount of photos I've taken I would have gone through 2-3 battery changes, and I'm still on the first set of batteries
The best camera I ever own
I love this camera, I can zoom and take pictures of all the beautiful flowers, birds, bees, butterflies
I an very happywith my choice of camera
I will informed all my family and my friends, so they will get one
Thank you, Missby
LOVE MY NIKON
Great camera
I've had Nikons before
The viewer on the back Is a good 3 inches to view your subject but your photos also
The zoom  brings the picture right to you
It is light and easy to hold with one hand
Highly recommend this camera
Best Camera
The Nikon Coolpix l830 is awesome, we have been having fun with this camera
It takes great night pictures and video, still checking all the extras out
So far this is worth every penny we spent on it
I would recommend it
Great camera that takes great pictures
Great camera that takes great pictures
Make sure you take the lens cap off before you turn it on
This seems like a no-brainer but but if you forget to do this, you can damage the lens mechanism
Amazing Camera but No Manual Mode
AMAZING CAMERA
I mainly bought the camera for its zoom and it hasn't failed me yet
Crisp pictures, easy to you use, and the battery life is the best I've come by
Its does really well in low light also
The only problems I've run into is I didn't realize there was no manual mode, and when its at its highest zoom it make a beeping nose( does not interfere with video)
Other wise this is an amazing camera
I need to find some time and just learn how
I need to find some time and just learn how it works
The pictures have been greaat so far
Top notch
This camera is great for a novice like myself
The picture quality is sharp and crisp and my friends think it's the coolest thing ever since sliced bread
The only drawback is that it works with AA  batteries but they seem to last long
So far I love it
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
It didn't take long to learn the features and functions
All around a great camera for an amateur like me
Fairly good camera for the price
I ordered this camera for a European trip because I did not want to lug around my large and heavy Canon 40D, and I wanted higher quality photos that can be achieved from a cell phone
I had a couple of issues with this camera
First of all, throw out the batteries that come with the camera
Mine died after only 2 days
I brought replacement batteries and they got me by for another week, and then those died too
My Canon has spoiled me because that battery lasts forever
It would be nice if the camera had a good battery that was rechargeable
Secondly, I had a hard time easily finding some of the settings that I desired
It felt a little like finding the needle in the haystack
I should have practiced more before leaving home
Thirdly, I didn't like the grip on the camera
I was forever hitting the playback button with my thumb, because that is the natural way to grip this camera
There is a small pad for your thumb, but its placement just felt unnatural
I also had a hard time getting the flash to work to fill in backlighting, etc
Also, you need  a VERY steady hand when shooting
Now that I am home, the photo quality seems to be pretty good - at least much better than anything you can get with the cell phone
So I think I'll keep it
It is lightweight, small, takes fairly good photos, and looks cool, too
Good camera, recommend
Nikon COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera is the greatest camera ever
I would like to recommend this camera to my friends
Great Camera
Great little camera
Bought it for my daughter's graduation; she loves it
Fairly simple to operate & it's not bulky
COOLPIX L830
I love the ease of use and the light weight
It is easy to focus and just point and shoot
Very very nice pics, the "auto modes" work great
Camera does everything I wanted it to do
Very very nice pics, the &#34;auto modes&#34; work great,
and I don't miss not having a viewfinder
the only annoyance is if you happen to turn the camera with the lens cap on, it displays a message and won't go away, even after removing the cap
Kinda makes sense, but just a slight inconvenience because you need to remove the lens cap first, then turn the camera back on
Awesome photos, a couple of reservations
I've taken this camera on two trips- one to Arizona, and one to France
I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the photographs
They are crisp and clear, and the color is beautiful
The zoom is fabulous, and most of the time, I didn't have problems with blurry zoomed photos
Even in low light, I never had to use a flash
In Arizona, I took lots of photos at an outdoor Chihuly exhibit in the Arizona Botanical Garden, both in the afternoon and early evening light
It was fun experimenting with the different scene modes at dusk
Also took lots of night shots in France, and they were also great
Some have complained of battery life, but I found them to last a really long time
I never changed batteries for the whole week in Arizona, and then added another couple of days of battery life in France, and those were with the batteries that came with the camera
I had purchased rechargeables, and they lasted the rest of the two weeks in France, with power to spare
My reservations-  Hate not having a viewfinder
If the photos weren't so great, I would have seriously thought about returning it
Seriously Nikon?  Put a viewfinder in this camera and it would get 10 stars
Also, the door for the batteries and SD card feels a little flimsy
Opening it is not too difficult, but the closing mechanism is a little awkward
Nothing but Awesome
There are still some features I have to use
Took this camera on a trip and absolutely loved the use of it in the canyons and on my favorite trails
No complaints whatsoever
I'm not a professional but it sure feels close to being one for me
Thanks for the input on the past gens that helped my purchase decision
My dad has the previous gen
THis camera is significantly more weight in the hand
Amazing camera
Takes excellent pictures and movies
Easy to use
Has a separate button for movies; hence you can take a movie, then a photo, then a movie, etc
, without going through menu
Best camera I have ever owned
(I have owned many canons and a panasonic lumix
) And the price was reasonable
cool nikon
great shots, zoom is great, and nice to handle
took pictures of granddaughters prom in front of window no back lighting
used flash as successed
It's a nice camera
just not for me
I purchased this camera after my Nikon Coolpix S8200 broke down on me again for the second time
While this camera is nice and takes decent pictures, I just couldn't deal with the size of it
Yes, it is still relatively small compared to other cameras, but I guess I'm just used to my old Nikon camera that could be easily accessible at moments notice
The zoom also bothered me due to A LOT of shakiness, which I understand happens at the highest zoom and being hand held, but again, I didn't experience that much of it with my previous camera
There was also noise coming from the camera when in zoom
it was quite irritating
I also didn't like that the flash is manual
I read that you had to manually do the flash prior to purchasing, but I figured I would be okay with it
I wasn't okay with it
It was annoying having to constantly open the flash when I needed it, even in auto mode
In the end, I only kept the camera for the weekend and decided that this particular camera just isn't for me
I have returned it and am now on the hunt again for a new camera
Happy wife,happy life
Can't rate higher than 4 stars because I haven't used this camera
I bought it for my wife as a gift,and she likes it so it was an excellent buy
Happy wife,happy life
great camera
i took this on a cruise and caught pic's of flying fish between the waves
I took shots of water propulsion system in action from 1/4 mile away and they all came out great
This camera is great
We bought this camera in anticipation of a trip to Alaska,  we are thrilled with the ease of use and quality of the photos
We highly recommend it
it's a great camera
A nice camera to use easy to handle takes great pictures used it at a family gathering a few weeks after getting it
WOW
I've only had this camera for a few days and am having a blast
It's got so many features I haven't tried them all as yet
It has 2 panorama modes, 180 degrees and 360 degrees and they're the best I've seen
No stitching photos together, just click and hold the shutter button and turn
When you've reached the end of your pan, just release the shutter button
You get a beautiful pan shot
I highly recommend this camera
You cannot go wrong with a Nikon
easy to use
Simple, easy to use
just point and shoot
Remarkable closeups
You dont have the convenience of a &#34;pocket&#34; point and shoot, but the picture quality is a lot better than the Canon pocket camera I had
love this camera
Bought this camera for many reasons and so far it's great
Sound is good on video, pictures are clean and sharp
I love the fact you can tilt the screen
Vacation is soon and it's going with me
I am used to a huge professional camera, this is small compact and takes great pictures
Nikon coolpix L830
Love the Nikon Coolpix l830
But can't seem to pick it up without pushing one of them silly bottoms
LOLIt really is a great camera
Rocky
Nikon L830
One of the features I love about this camera is all the special effects you can shoot pictures with
Plus the zoom is smooth and is great when trying to bring in that wildlife that is far off in the distance
I have found that the video is really great compared to an older video camera I had
The picture and sound are so much better
Plus here again, you can shoot your video with special effects
Great camera and so far I have no complaints on it at all
All of my photos have turned out great and it's so easy to use
Love it
Nifty camera with inherent problems
This is quite a nice little camera
But because there is no viewfinder, it is difficult to take pictures, as it is very hard to keep it still, especially with the zoom
Ideal camera for sophisticated shutterbug
The COOLPIX L830 is a very sophisticated camera for the price
It has a lengthy instruction book and will take time to master its various intricacies
Once mastered, it should prove to be a very nice camera to own and operate
Amazing quality
Best camera I've ever had
I've had enough of those tiny compact cameras now and I'm never going back
Quality is amazing
I have taken very good care of this camera
I have had the camera just over the 30 day guarantee with Amazon and the lens stopped functioning
It will not take pictures, &#34;Lens Error&#34; comes up whenever I turn it on
Very disappointing
I have taken very good care of this camera
Great pics
Easy to use
Nice pics
Zoom works great and is able to focus quickly
Used at our daughters graduation outdoors
Not able to sit close
Got great pics with the zoom
Five Stars
Love this Camera highly recommennd
Awesome camera
Takes awesome pictures
Great camera for the price
Anyone can use it
Love the simplicity, the 34x zoom, the easy picture modes and manual setttings, the video, the sound
basically everything about it
I did a ton of research on the camera and it's close relative out there the Canon PowerShot SX510 HS
Though, these cameras are very similar in their class and both manufacturers have excellent reputations, there was a line up of subtle differences that were slightly &#34;improved&#34; with the Nikon Coolpix L830
I am sure I would have been content with the Canon but I love this Nikon
For a $200 range camera, try to avoid expecting too much from zoom without a tri-pod but even still know that the picture is not going to be perfectly clear zoomed all the way to 34x
Also, I would not expect a great deal from the image stabilization
For a camera in its class it does a great job with both of the features I mentioned just know it is simply not going to have the abilities of a camera like say the Canon EOS Rebel T3i or above
Great camera for the price
Got this for my wife
She loves it
Takes great pictures for the price
A wonderful camera
I absolutely LOVE this camera
It was well worth the purchase
We used this on our trip to San Antonio and Corpus Christi and were not disappointed in the quality of the pictures taken by it
I was really stressed about which type of camera to buy and was unsure on if this camera would work
I have not been disappointed
THe clarity of it is wonderful and it is extremely easy  to use
I highly recommend it
Five Stars
I love it
But I had to upload the directions for all the features
But the pictures are beautiful
AMAZON
COM LIKELY THINKS I'VE GONE STARK RAVING BONKERS - I GOT THIS & THREE OTHER CAMERAS IN A WEEKS TIME
I have been buying up the best cameras that still use AA batteries because; I have cerebral palsy and do not drive
People who drive think nothing of motoring over to the nearest photo store to get their camera's specialty brand specific sometimes even model specific battery
Being disabled I can not drive, trust me I tried driving and lets say everyone in Maryland breathed a sigh of relief when I renewed my MTA Maryland Disability Transportation Card
You see I never want to be caught without batteriesif ever I am in the right place at the right time with my camera at the ready
Being disabled I do not have the luxury of being able to pop round the the Ye Olde Photo Shoppe for a bracing battery refill
However I did not want just any camera that used AA Battery power
I wanted a camera that took awesome pictures and this new Nikon Coolpix L830 does that with ease
This Nikon Coolpix L830 takes four AA batteries so it is a bit of a battery hog but, I feel the batteries last longer
You would think the batteries weigh the camera down but nope, this camera is small and light
Other reviews suggest thie Nikon Coolpix L830 suffers in build quality well that bug must have been fixed
There was NOTHING at all the least bit loose on my new Nikon Coolpix L830
I got the red camera and I saw finger prints mine of course, but that does not bother me
Opening the battery door is a real beast until you get the hang of it
A better battery door solution is definitely needed for this camera period, I'd take off half a star on my rating if I could
The Nikon Coolpix L830 is no where near as noisey as my Pentax K5 or K30 even if they take batter pictures
The Nikon Coolpix L830 does not exactly slip into a shirt pocket but it can be completely concealed in one of my big brothers massive hands
I wouldnot suggest the Nikon Coolpix L830 for guys with massive or even large hands since everything is tightly packed onto the camera
My brother can use my Nikon Coolpix L830 and even likes it but he struggles like a gaint trying to change the a new borns diaper
I am NOT a professional protographer
I am not even an avid photo-bug
I am just a disabled dude who is fascinated with the art of taking pictures that appeal to me
I love this Nikon Coolpix L830 because; the more I learn about it the more it becomes an extention of my imagineation
I am just a beginner in the world of photographn but this Nikon Coolpix L830 makes me feel like a photographer with ideas far beyond my novice station
A great point and shoot
A great value, I have had 3 other point and shot cameras( 2 Fuji,1 cannon) this one is the best
Great pictures and I like the 34x zoom lens
The camera is not to heavy to carry all day
I just returned from a 3 week vacation to three national parks
I must have taken 300 pictures and at least 6 videos, I use standard Duracell batteries and never had a power shortage
I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a very solid point and shoot camera
Great Camera
After using a Coolpix L110 for work I liked the ergonomics so I purchased the L830 for my personal use
Not small and thats a good thing
Beefy enough to hold comfortably in one hand and takes great pictures easy
The zoom has an autofocus which truly does work
I took closeups at a ballgame and razor sharp without a tripod
The macro took great pictures of flowers and the detail was awesome
I'm a Cannon man back in the day but Nikon has won me over
Excellent camera
It had more uses than I expected
Excellent camera
It had more uses than I expected so I'm still learning
Great in dark places and long distances
Bought this for a conference event
Got super pictures in low light with no flash
Zoom pictures up on stage came out clear and bright
The flash is a little overpowering so thought I'd put a screen on it
Most of my indoor shots were without flash and came out wonderfully
Love the 34x zoom, was like I was standing right next to my subject from across the auditiorium
Like that I can replace batteries immediately and don't have to wait and charge them
Feels good in your hand and easy to handle
Love it
Amazing Camera
I love this camera
I've always loved taking pictures and this camera is so easy to use and takes great pictures
We went camping this weekend and I took a picture of the moon
The picture was breathtaking
you can see the moon and every detail perfectly
Love it
I recommend it to everyone
Great Camera
Great camera takes good pictures
I like my camera
This was a good purchase
Easy to use
Good zoom I'm happy
Attention to detail lacking
First off, I am very happy with my purchase
I was looking for an easy/solid point and shoot, and the L830 came through
With a 2 year old, I want to capture as much as possible without having to worry about bulk and lenses
The photo and video quality is excellent
Two annoying things though (and I'm sure it was to cut down on cost
Give me a scroll wheel to go through images and setting and for God's sake give me a view finder
The LCD is great, but annoying as all heck in bright conditions
If you can get past those two things, this is a great choice
Four Stars
This camera takes great pictures, very simple to operate
So far, so good
I took a couple of pictures with this came and they came out so beautiful
I'm still getting to know how it works, so it'll be awhile before I become a novice
Been taking pictures for over 30 years and needed to upgrade
The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is
1, It repeatedly report &#34;lens error&#34; and now died
I have to change one
If you touch the lens when it zooms in or out, it reports &#34;lens error
&#34;2, The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is very light
3, It uses 4 AA batteries
Even Duracells are only durable for 300-500 shots
If taking movies, it can work for only less than one hour
4, The images are not very sharp
Just What We Wanted
We ordered this as a gift for our son's graduation
It is a larger camera (not pocket) size
but that was what we were looking for
It's very easy to use and takes great pictures
Excellent Product
The package didnt contain the leather pouch or 4GD SDHC card as promised at the checkout
But, the product was intact, brand new and with all other packaging items
Image quality is superb and one will love it
A Beginners Dream Camera
If you're looking for a great entry level point and shoot camera with many advanced features then you can't go wrong
Love it
So much better than my other cameras
I have had 3 different cameras since the beginning of the digital camera age, and this one is by far the best
I can take pictures so much faster than before and don't have to wait to look at the picture or for it it process
It is not as small as my last camera but definitely more compact than my first
The zoom is phenomenal
I sat in my kitchen and took a picture of one ornament on the tree in the family room, and I could see the clarity as if I were right in front of it
The continuous shots I took were a little blurry, but I think with some practice, this may improve
As stated in some other reviews, the flash comes up where your finger typically rests, but I have just learned to move my finger out of the way
Just something to get used to
After reading the reviews on several different sites and looking at ratings, this camera is well worth the money
I am just glad I can have a compact camera that takes next to SLR pictures
Great camera
This camera is amazing
Takes great pictures and videos
It is definitely better than other high-end cameras that I have owned
It records great videos with stereo sound
The menu is very intuitive and user friendly
Almost Perfect
I am looking for a compact digital camera for a long time
I am using DSLR but sometimes I really need a small and talented compact camera
I compare the Canon and sony cameras with S8100 and I can say that this is a clean win for Nikon
It has a good optic, nice 10x zoom, very sharp and detailed LCD, VR, wide angle lens and a perfect look
Also it has a very quality and good looking finish
I highly recommended
the flash ruins most pics
the video quality of the camera is excellent, but all of my photos using the flash are overexposed
i'm really disappointed with the quality of the flash, but without it, the camera is good
Best coolpix I ever had
In its small size it packs a sufficiently powerful zoom, excellent resolution and high reslution video
Flexible enough for most situations, large and luminous screen
Outstanding Camera With Numerous Small Downsides
After using a Canon for a number of years, I was pushed away from Canon by the fact that their newer cameras have an unusually slow continuous shooting mode
I have been VERY HAPPY with my purchase
I think this camera offers unparalleled value in its category
However, it has a few minor downsides which are minor, but regular annoyances
I'll start with the strengths
As I see it the benefits are:(1) Small size--small enough to fit, in the case, in a large pocket, or out of the case, in a much smaller one
Convenient case by the way
(2) Ease of use - it doesn't matter if you're used to another brand of pocket camera before: this one is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up
(3) OUTSTANDING low-light no-flash performance
I can't emphasize this point enough: this is one of the main reasons why I bought the camera
ISO 400 and 800 work very well: 400 is especially sharp
There's an option for 1600 and 3200, and while I use them infrequently as they're nosier, I'm glad they're an option
(4) Image stabilization works really well, which I'm sure contributes to (3), but it also contributes to low shutter-speed far-zoomed-out pics as well
Taking pictures of stationary targets, the camera handles gracefully down to 1/5th of a second, which I find absolutely remarkable
(5) This camera takes very, very good photos
I think Nikon put a really good sensor in this camera, creating a balanced overall package rather than just inflating the megapixel and zoom rating the way some brands do
(6) Face recognition actually works
I don't really care about this, but it's kinda fun and is a bonus
(7) Quick startup time
Things in general are fast, except for two problems which I discuss below
Quick time between photos, surprisingly quick flash cycling even
Caveats / Downsides: (These are all relatively minor complaints, not deal-breakers, although they're all things that are annoyances that I notice on a regular basis
)(1) ISO speed, which I change VERY frequently, requires going into the menu to change
This is very cumbersome
[EDIT:] addressed in comment, thanks
(3) Flash performance is relatively poor, especially in contrast to everything else about this camera
Flash photos tend to have exceptionally poor color, relative to how well the camera does everything else
Also, the auto mode really doesn't handle the flash gracefully--you need to fidget with things to get sharp photos
Since I don't like using a flash, it's not a big downside, but I do want to point out that this camera really lags behind in this area
Sometimes if you just point-and-shoot in auto mode, and take a flash photo, the result can be pretty awful
either bad lighting, too grainy, and the biggest problem, terrible color balance
You can learn how to work with the flash but it takes adjustment and fidgeting and you can't just expect to take good flash photos out of the box
The only good thing about the flash is that it cycles very quickly
(4) Writing images, even with a high speed memory card, is very slow
If you take a number of photos even in moderately quick succession, and then close the camera, you often have to wait several seconds, which is a bit annoying
Deleting images is even slow
(5) Continuous shooting mode, while very fast, only supports 5 photos at once
This is really not enough for me
Writing in continuous mode can be very slow, and you can't shoot again until it's done--the wait is about 12 seconds at the highest resolution
By bumping down to 2048x1536 you can dramatically speed this up to 5 sec, and you can get a really quick cycling by using the tiny 640x480 resolution
(6) Perhaps a bit overzealous on the noise correction
Sometimes when you edit out noise, information is lost, and when I really zoom in on the photos produced at low ISO's, I think some sharpness has often been lost, and I wish the camera would leave these photos grainier, as it's always possible to edit them (sometimes better than the camera could itself) after the fact, but it's not possible to get back what's lost
So, bottom line?  Excellent camera
No real contenders in its size / price range
However, not perfect, and it could be substantially improved
Some of the downsides are things that
Excellent camera
This camera is in every way awesome
I couldnt have purchased a better one
The pictures come out remarkable
We were looking at purchasing the S9000 camera, but this one had better reviews and now I know why
Nikon Coolpix S8100 Don't lend it out
Great camera
I am very happy with most aspects of the camera although I haven't had time to thoroughly evaluate it
My friend enjoys the shake reduction which saves her quite a few pictures
Viewfinder image very crisp
Pictures excellent
Only flaw is that I tend to hold the camera with my left fingers on the top of the case, but that prevents the flash from popping up
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
0-Inch LCD (Black)I had considered a DSLR, but thought that this model would probably do almost anything I wanted
However, I may have to buy another camera anyway as my friend doesn't want to part with the S8100
This is also the reason that I haven't explored all the features of the camera
Great night shots but washed out in bright daylight
I have used this camera for 4 months, taken it on 4 trips - 1 beach, 1 cruise, 1 city, 1 nature/camping
I was replacing my Canon SD1000, which I loved
I wanted a fast point-n-shoot camera
This camera doesn't fully satisfy my needs and I'm overall a little disappointed
The camera takes great night pictures - I have had great luck at concerts and outdoors with the Night Landscape (more so than the Night Portrait which uses flash)
I got some cool pictures of Carlsbad Caverns in NM which are minimally lit
It's also great for taking flashless pictures inside somewhere like an art gallery
I'm not a photographic expert so I don't know what to call it when the camera enhances photos but it does a great job
I've also played with the Continuous and timer modes to get some amazing full moon pictures
However, issues (for me):- this camera is much bulkier than my Canon
I don't think they are even in the same class so maybe this isn't a fair criticism
But it doesn't have a flat front profile
So no putting this camera in the back pocket of tight jeans, which is something I want do often
- lag or hesitation where I try to take a picture quickly but it won't focus and therefore won't take the picture (usually after I just turned it on but sometimes randomly)
This has caused me to lose some great shots
- battery must be charged in camera, which means attached to the cord
WHY?  Why why why do they do this?  I suppose it's to be able to have a USB charger but for me this is really annoying
For one thing, I like having 2 batteries that I can charge and swap
And I like not having my camera precariously perched on a hotel window sill whilst charging
- takes pretty crappy pictures in bright sunlight
Once in a while I'll get a winner but more often than not, they look washed out
I've tried tweaking the settings a little bit and choosing various scenes but the pictures just look bad
I don't want to have to tweak a point-n-shoot
I want it to take good pictures for me
issue I should have known about:- The screen is amazing but I was so enamored with it that I didn't realize there was no viewfinder
Consequently, it's very tough to take pictures in the sunlight
Which I guess is OK because they turn out bad anyway ;-)Finally
this is probably user-idiocy but I cannot figure out how to view/play images without the lens being engaged
It's very awkward and I always worry about people touching it when I'm passing the camera around
Eventually the power settings kick in and the lens retracts, but every other camera I've seen has a PLAY setting that doesn't engage the lens
What the heck - can anyone give me some help here??I left on a trip after only having the camera for a week and hadn't really road tested it
So I am stuck with it now
I do appreciate the night pictures and the 12mp
And I've played some with the video
On the cruise I was less worried about packing light and cords and such so I brought both cameras and chose depending on the situation (Nikon at night, Canon on most excursions)
I love this camera
I did a lot of research before I bought it
It was highly rated and true to the reviews
Great quality and the pictures are clear and it has a fast shutter speed to catch  my 18mo old son
Only draw back is its not water proof so now I have to get another after dropping it in the ocean
My fault but I will be getting another
Excellent point and shoot, with 1 star removing flaw
This camera takes EXCELLENT photos for a point and shoot
The shots out of this rival in color and sharpness that of my DSLR (when the dslr is shooting in
jpg format), unfortunately when shooting against a dslr  with this in
jpg and the dslr shooting
raw, this still won't touch a dslr BUT this probably has the best looking point and shoot photos i've seen across many brands (sony, kodak, pentax, canon, and olympus)
Unfortunately this camera seriously lacks in one major category that is important to certain people
its continuous shooting mode
The continuous shooting mode is as fast as they describe, but the flaw is that it doesn't work like other cameras
With other cameras you hold down the button and it starts shooting (at whatever its shooting speed is such as 2
5fps) and doesn't stop until you release the button
With this camera it is much different, you hit the button once and it shoots 5 incredibly fast frames, then the whole camera locks itself up for 30seconds or so while it tries to process those images
Its awful
We tried to shoot various live action sports with it and it does its 5 shots in the first second or so of pushing the button, then we are stuck again for another minute, at which point if we didn't get the shot in the first 5 shots, your screwed
I've had many cameras and this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST implementation of continuous shooting I have ever seen
It would be better have a slower FPS that sits and shoots 1 frame/second (like my old cannon p&s;) but a least you can hold it down for an entire sports sequence and hopefully get some of the action
BOTTOM LINE: BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND GREAT FOR STILLS, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON TRYING TO SHOOT ANY MOVING OBJECTS FORGET ABOUT THIS CAMERA
Oh, of note, the 'so called' manual settings on this camera are very poor
this is somewhat of a neutral thing because some people love them and others hate them
Back lit CMOS, where have you been all my life?
What a great little camera
I was not in need of a new point and shoot, but it was on a great deal and I had a gift card to burn up so I took a shot
Right on target
The lens has a great range to it, the wide angle is indispensable
Controls are easy and intuitive
I love the one button on and off for the video
The video itself is quite amazing
Full 1080p out of such an inexpensive and already feature packed camera with the quality it offers is amazing
There are only a couple of minute issues I have with it overall
The lens gets a little soft in the long end
The wide angle is so sharp, it rivals my DSLR
And for the video, if you leave it set to continuous AF, when you play it back you can hear the focus mechanism clicking over and over again to regain focus
Both issues are easy to deal with once you know they exist
Don't zoom to the full length and don't use C-AF
Problems solved
Every time I review the pictures from this great little camera, I am always amazed at how good this inexpensive point and shoot is
Not an Expert, But an Enthusiast
I love taking photos
This camera makes it simple
I enjoy all the options and the zoom is spectacular
The pictures are crisp
Truly happy with my camera
Best camera ever
I got a picture of a bald eagle, sitting on a telephone pole, on the other side of the Yellow River, must have been 60-70 yards away
Looks like I am standing right next to him
Great pictures, not fuzzy, no distortion, even when I've zoomed it to the max
This Camera Horrible
I bought this camera for my mother
She wanted a semi-professional camera for her Christmas Vacation to the Dominican Republic
I heard a lot of great reviews, and decided to buy it
My Mom is very careful of her things, and even with her being cautious of the camera, After 3 weeks, the shutter broke
She had to end the last days of her vacation taking pictures with lenses shadowing in the pictures
Also The White balance was horrible
Everytime you would take pictures of somebody wearing white, there would be a white glow shining in the picture
Also, the fact that the flash was right under where you would put your fingers, made it longer to take pictures because sometimes the flash would pop out under the fingers and you would have to do a double take
That whole full HD video was not HD at all
You cant even film at night time
I wasted $74
on a HD memory card, because a regular memory card was not capable of filming it
This whole camera was a mess
It couldnt even do good recognition sometimes leaving the pictures blurry
I ended up using photoshop and picasa to edit the pictures to try and make it look "professional" something I didnt expect to do by purchasing this camera
Thankfully the store that I bought the camera was able to give me my Money Back
I ended up buying a Sony 14
0 MEGAMIXEL Cybershot DSC-H55
I had to buy an extra memory stick but it's worth it
Now this is a camera
Nikon needs to get it together, not only did I waste my time, Money, but I ended up with alot of bad pictures on one of the most memorable vacation trips my mother has had
I know this sony wont let me down
Great for the money - close ups with flash it too much some times
We enjoy the 8100, we had an 8000 and it was great also
Great pictures and easy to use
Auto settings work well
Will make good pictures in low light situations and in total darkness if necessary
In real estate we make pictures in vacant houses with no power and this is a great asset
On very close up shots, we have experienced almost too much light
Flash pop up is new but getting use to it
We have 2 yr old Grandson who enjoys having his picture made as much an any 2 yr old
It grabs a quick picture when we need it
Nikon S8100, I love it
So take my review for what its worth
I am not a photo genius, but i definitley have learned a lot more since i recieved it 2 months ago
Pros:-Takes amazing pictures, crystal clear even when zoomed out
-I can control all the options i need to as a rookie
-Powers up and is ready to shoot at the blink of an eye
-Durable enough for me
-Takes amazing panoramas
-Battery Life lasts me about 2 weeks, and ever patrol i go on i am taking pictures, my job requires it
-Comes with some rad software to help with editing
-CMOS is AWESOME
Cons if you call them that:-I am still worried that the lens is going to stick out, but i clean it daily and it hasnt stuck yet
-Sometimes it takes a while focus when its in AUTO mode (only during lower light conditions)
-The flash is in a funny spot, but i dont get upset about it
-Yes the power on button is small, but i can always get it turned on even when i have tactical gloves on
Granted, i am currently deployed in Afghanistan where dust is always a problem
Having a nice case is key too
I did a lot of research and bought the Case-Logic case, which is perfect for the camera, and an extra battery or soft bristled brush to dust off the lens housing before stowing it away
I bought a camera the day i left the States to come out here, and it didnt even last 2 days
the screen cracked and couldnt turn it on
I can honestly say i am very satisfied with this purchase
I did buy it before all the cameras went on sale for Christmas, and i was bummed i didnt wait
But after a gorgeous sunset that i caputred with 7 shots and fitted to a panorama
that picture alone made the camera worth it
Definitley puts my buddies cameras to shame, and they all paid in the same price range
Crossing my fingers the lens doesnt start acting up, i will update my review if anything goes wrong
Good Photo Quality
Camera takes very nice photos
The gold color is perfect
Charge lasts a long time
The only thing I absolutely do not like is the flash
The placement is very awkward
I always end up placing my finger on top it
Otherwise, it's a great camera
Love it
I purchased this awesome camera a little over a year & a half ago and it is by far the best digital camera I have purchased by far
Once I play with the settings just right it takes amazing pictures
It is a bit on the heavy, bulky side but I don't mind it much
I can't give it a full 5 stars since the battery life could be better
The flash really drains the battery life quickly
I've only dropped this digital camera once within the year & half I had it & it is still working perfectly like it did day one plus no dings or scratches either
The 10x zoom is more then enough, I mainly use this camera to take everyday family pictures so the zoom does not get used much
Although there are some modes I am still trying to get a hang off which come off a bit difficult to use
Aside from that it is definitely worth the money
Great
Works nice and takes video also
Easy to use
easy to upload and print photos
I added a memory card and can switch from internal to external memory depending on my memory needs
broke after 2 months
I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my husband, meant to be a replacement for a 5 year old Canon Powershot
We have 2 small children and the shutter speed had been an issue on the older camera, so we were hoping this would be an upgrade- unfortunately the speed was not much faster
Also, after 2 months the lens cover stopped opening when we turned on the power rendering the camera unusable
I wish it had broken a month earlier so that I could just return it to Amazon but now we have to deal directly with Nikon, which has been a pain
This camera was way too expensive to have such poor quality
Delighted
I've purchased two of these cameras for gifts and the recipients were delighted
Great camera with excellent features and easy to use
Great camera
Enough has been said on the reviews to add my comments in any detail, but overall this is a great camera - great photos so far in a variety of lighting conditions
Side by side comparisons with lesser cameras bring out the start difference in color clarity and definition
Image quality over the large zoom range is a huge plus for this product, even in low light conditions
It is interesting that there are so many negative reviews on this product - but in looking at them most of them are related to the video quality, not still image which is uniformly rated 5, or in only some cases a 4
Have not had a chance to try out the video in detail but the few shots I've taken look incredibly good
But if your main concern is still images, the S8100 is unparalleled
It is to me misleading for readers to see a 3
5 star rating for this product, IMHO
Great Point and Shoot
I bought this camera for my wife and she's loving it
We were looking for a really good pics with a great auto mode and we narrowed our choices to the Nikon 8100, Sony HX5V, ZS5 and Canon SX210is
We decided to go with the Nikon because of the 1080p video, cmos chip for lowlight shooting and 914k pixel LCD
The pics come out beautiful but you may need to reshoot sometimes due to flash overexposure or blurriness in low light (pretty standard with these mega zoom compacts)
The video is also great just be sure to get a class 6 SDHC card or better and change the options to HQ video and pics(for some reason Nikon defaults to the lower quality)
I also recommend not using the continuous AF (you'll hear clicking sounds in the video)
I'm not crazy about Nikon not supplying a battery charger, instead you charge the battery in the camera with the usb cord
Come on Nikon
It also doesn't automatically reposition pics taken in portrait mode (you'll need to put the camera upright to review)
Hopefully they fix that with updated firmware
I wish the wide zoom (30mm) was better but it's ok
The menus could be a little more intuitive and a printed manual would have been great (it's on a disk like all other camera's these days)
Finally, the software Nikon supplies is lousy
Come to think of it, all photo software from camera manufacturers is lousy
Just go with Picasa for photo organizing and light editing and Photoscape for more robust editing
Both free
Anyway, it may sound like I'm nitpicking but it is a pretty good p&s
;  A few firmware fixes will make this camera shine
I recommend it for someone wanting a simple to use camera, great pics, low light, 10x zoom and stereo 1080p video
If you want manual controls look elsewhere
LOVE THIS CAMERA
The only place I could find this camera was on Amazon
Wanted RED, who doesn't???  Found it here and love, love, love this camera
Love Nikon
Convenient, easy to carry, good photos
Works for a basic need
I've had it for a year
I've had a heck of a time with this camera
I got it a little over a year ago, and I should have returned it from the get-go
I mostly use it for going out with friends and in casual settings (the occasional nature shot)
Here's my experience with it for the past year:The bad:-about 1/10 pictures in lower light areas would come out COMPLETELY whitewashed, no matter the setting I used-it was really difficult to focus it on up close things-it took forever to focus-I'm now getting lens error readings (and, like I said, I've had it for only a year)-it randomly deleted my graduation photos
I was able to get them back by downloading a program on my computer and reading the card separately from my camera, but my god that sucked
-The pop-up flash was really inconvenient
telling people over and over again to "watch your finger because the flash pops up" got really old
It's RIGHT where your finger goes for how you would naturally hold a camera-It's really heavy for a camera, so it's difficult to just throw it in a clutch or carry it around-It's oddly shaped, and I was never able to find a camera case for itThe good:-When you do manage to get a good shot, it's a REALLY good shot-It's great outdoors-The zoom is amazingOverall, I would not recommend this camera
I'm about to resell mine and get a cute, cheap point and shoot
Nice pics, weak lens cover
Takes good pictures - minor low light issues, but after 10 months the lens cover (plastic pieces slide over lens when closed, supposed to slide away when open), is no longer opening
You have to physically spread the lens covers apart until they stay apart
We will take it to local camera shop for repairs
A snap on/off cover would be a better option for lens cap
Battery is Useless
I was very happy with this purchase at first
I have had it less than a year though and the battery is shot
In previous cameras I have owned the battery has lasted much longer
I don't know what the deal is but it makes me want to try a different manufacturer next time
Be sure to spend some time with the instructions
This is a great little camera
There are so many features, it can be difficult to figure out the one you want to use on the fly
The unit is small, compact, light, with a great picture quality
I have been using my new camera to photograph action scenes of my new invention, The FlashBak Rear bike light
Sample photos will soon be available on our web site: [
] This camera is a quality product and I bought it despite, or because of the Ashton Kutcher commercials(I'm not too sure)
Great Alternative To My DSLR
I use this camera as an alternative to carrying my DSLR
It's perfect for this use
The S8100 is easy to use and the pictures are extraordinary
The photos taken in low light are fantastic; much better than I would have imaged
Designing the pop up flash on the left side of the camera you're the user tends to hold the camera, does not quite make sense to me; however, this was not a deal breaker to purchasing this camera
After a few uses, you'll figure out exactly where you need to place our index finger so it does not infer with the flash
Great camera
I bought this camera last March
I'm still very happy with it
It is a little bit challenging to take a photo when focusing on something far away, but it is a matte of getting developing a technique
Zoom
Really bought this model because I wanted the 10x zoom feature
I'm struggling with the lever that zooms the lens
It doesn't respond as quickly as I expected and am missing some good shots
Will keep working with it but don't think this should have to happen
Love the Nikon Coolpix S8100
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has more features than I need
But being well within my price range, I couldn't resist buying it
It's everything it promises
Very thin and light
Great telescoping lense, big viewing screen, compensates beautifully for movement and has easy to understand settings
I love how easily I can switch from stills to movie mode
Be aware it does NOT come with a removeable memory card
Though the internal memory did allow me to take 22 pictures and a 15 second video before running out of space, so there's plenty of room to try it out before investing in a memory card
As with any small camera, holding it without interfering with flash etc
takes a little practice for those of us used to larger cameras
But the grip bars on the front of this model help
A buying tip: If you are attracted to the latest, greatest model in a line of cameras but it's beyond the budget or has more features than you know you need, check out earlier versions of that model
Not only will the price be better, but you might find the earlier model still has all the features you want
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12

Problem with edges
Does anyone else have a problem with edges
For example, I took a picture our of a car window, and the edges of the side view mirror (integral to the picture) have lines across them
Same with the gutters on a neighbor's house, and the dashboard of a small airplane
Help
Blueberry with Nikon S8100
Fantastic camera
I'm a bargain shopper
It seems the past 3-4 years I have always purchased whatever point-and-shoot camera is on sale on Black Friday and I am always displeased with it within several months of usage and then buy another one the next year
This year I came to terms with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment and decided I would buy a GOOD camera because it is worth the extra $50 or $100 to have the fantastic quality
I'm not a professional photographer, nor do I spend hours on my computer editing photos & video
I'm a mom of two small children, I work full-time and I'm a grad student - I don't have time to spend making my pictures better with software
I wanted to be able to take great pictures of my family and friends, etc
at various events and be able to print them right then & there without any editing
This camera is it
The backlighting feature and the night shot feature is AWESOME
It's great for those school programs when the lighting is dark
And the zoom is incredible
I just got back from taking pics at my daughter's Christmas program and all of my other cameras I've had there's no way I could get a good close-up shot, they would always be blurry
This one I could zoom right up to her face and it was crystal clear
I love this camera
It is easy to use, great features, and compact so you can still tote it around everywhere you go
I definitely recommend it
Very good camera
HD video OK, quality of images better than waited, it's a great camera, good size, good value
I am satisfied
Nothing Special
I bought this camera because it was supposed to be fast and take good low light pictures
It failed at both
I went back to the Cannon SX130IS which is a much better camera
S8100 is a winner
I purchased this for my wife, its really the first "better" camera we have owned
I decided to spend the money for a good one and this seems to be it
The camera operates very easy, if you have used a digital camera in the past this should be no different
It comes with its own rechargeable battery
Thats a plus in my book
The pictures we have taken so far are so crisp and clear it will blow you away
The face recognition system works really well, how did they get it to do that?5
The self timer and smile timer are great when you want a family shot without having to ask people to take your picture
The 1080p HD video is records is unbelievable, then plug the camera right into the TV via HDMI and watch video or view pictures
There are alot, I mean alot of variables you can do with this camera, but if all your interested in is point and shoot then it does that very well as thats all my wife is interested in
On the other hand I can make it do more complex things
The camera seems pretty well built, this is our first nikon, we have always had milnota or kodak in the past
as of now I'll never go back
I thought this camera was very well priced also
The picture quality is amazing
I hope they pay Ashton Kutcher alot for his advertising because thats what lead me to this camera
EDIT: 1-13-2011We took our camera to the colts/jets playoff game and got some great video before the game and some great pictures
The zoom on this is really good, even from the 20 yd line I was able to snap close up pics of the colts on the opposite end of the field
Color is great
Also I noticed no zoom motor noise while watching the video
We also took some shots outside after dark and this camera really excels at night
We have always had trouble getting good shots of the kids during school programs due to poor lighting, I dont think that will be the problem anymore after using this camera at night
Not really great
Not very good
The camera has significant focusing issues while shooting video especially if you go from a bright area to a shaded area of vice versa
Also zooming and focusing sounds can be heard very loudly in any shot video
It almost makes the video useless
Also seems to have issues focusing sometimes at the end of the zoom
Really disappointing
Most expensive point & shoot I have owned
I received this camera as gift in December
It is now April and my camera is already back to Nikon for repair
There is a problem with the USB/AV port on the camera
After following all of their directions for mailing my camera (costing close to $20), I receive my estimate of repairs
It is, of course, not covered by warranty -- after 4 months
So, now I have put out an additional $104 for them to correct the problem (that they are saying is impact damage, yet it has never had any impact)
The pictures are awesome, and I would not have had it fixed for that price except, if the USB/AV port is bad, you cannot upload photos OR charge the battery
What a waste of time & money -- are the pictures worth it?  I probably could have gotten shots just as nice from a Canon or Kodak (and will in the future)
Nikon compact camera
This camera is very easy to use and takes high quality photos
The photo editing software that is included with it is also outstanding
Okay camera, mediocre image quality, poor controls
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 is an okay little camera
For me it was not worthwhile due to two simple factors
The controls were poor and very simplistic
Also the image quality was very sub-par
In many instances just to make simple exposure tweaks you have to go several levels deep in the menu system
I could forgive the lack of control if the image quality was spectacular, but it is far from it
Low light performance was particularly dissapointing, and white balance was very eratic
Again, I don't mind relying on auto and scene modes on a point and shoot but those modes have to do at least a decent job of interpreting the scene
Sorry Nikon, going back to canon brand
Cool camera
I sold my Canon A640 and replaced it with this and I am very pleased with the sharpness of the photos
My husband needed a camera that corrected for shake, and so far, this one is impressive
I would give it 5 stars but the flash is right where I would normally put my left hand when holding it so you have to adjust how you hold it so that the flash can pop up
Video is sharp although I have not used it extensively yet
Also, so far I have found it to be quite fast with little shutter lag and good in low light situations
All in all, very impressive camera
However, with Christmas shopping upon us, I have noticed some lower prices being advertised so check around for the best price before you purchase one as a local chain store might be less expensive
Can't get it shipped
I ordered this camera and accessories on the 1st and chose the free shipping because the camera was shown as "in stock" at Amazon
The camera did not ship and most of the accessories already have
I don't understand why an in stock item did not ship
In stock items shipped free always arrive in less than 5 days but since this one did not ship I may not see it until next week
Very disappointing, not what I was used to from Amazon
Great Point and Shoot
I love this camera
It takes great pictures, is a good size, and works quickly
The battery has great endurance
I dont mind how the flash needs to pop up, it was an easy adjustment to make
Very happy with this purchase, especially for $200
Nearly perfect
I'm a midrange amateur photographer, upgrading from an earlier Olympus 3mp digital
The Olympus had nice features (8x optical zoom, manual capabilities and threaded lens barrel)
So, why the strong rating for a point and shoot Nikon?1
It feels good and solid
The main operating features are very intuitive
The mode dial is well thought out; the auto scene select mode is dynamite
I like that it automatically goes to or from facial reconition to macro, etc
I like having backlit as a mode dial option
Battery life is good
Video operation is straight forward and the finished product is great
Bottom line, this camera captures the image I want captured; every time, in stunning quality
That's what I wanted and hoped for
I haven't been disappointed
nikon coolpix S8100
This is the best point and shoot camera
This is my third camera,all different brands,but this is great in low light and great if you have a shakie hand
Picture quality is unbelievable
Bought it, returned it
After hours of research I had high hopes for this camera
I have always had Canon's for a pocket sized camera but really thought this one was it
Boy was I wrong
First of all
BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT THE FLASH
The placement is absurd
When the camera detects a flash is needed, it automatically pops up
right where your left finger holds the camera
This resulted in "red" pictures as the shutter fired while the flash, impeded by my finger, only popped up part way and so didn't actually illuminate anything
Picture quality on auto and scene was marginal
I have never shot so many blurry pictures in a 1 week span before
I am used to pulling out my camera, hitting the on button and shooting quickly
not so much here
A steady hand is required at all times or forget it
Since you need to be mindful of the flash placement, holding this camera is awkward further exasperating the issue
I could go on but suffice to say, I was very unhappy
Thank you to Amazon for undoing my mistake
I wound up with a Sony
yes, a Sony
DSCX-HX5V - which I LOVE
If you want a flexible, easy, point and shoot
this IS the one
so far so good
Well, as the title suggests, so far so good
No problems getting started and no problems with the photo software that came with it
Takes some really killer macro photos and zoomed photos and thus far I am impressed
Flash location is a bit off, but I'll get used to holding it a little closer to the edges
Battery has lasted well over 200 pics in a variety of conditions (flash/no flash) but i am still ordered a backup for those long days of photographing things and people and stuff
I am impressed and cant wait to get more comfortable with it
OK
We bought this camera to replace our three year old one
Very nice and compact with the easy of use for features but almost all picture were blurry when used on stand or taken by camera in hand
My wife and I did a fair amount of research and we kept arriving at this particular camera--point and shoot w/ more than adequate zoom,mp's, and it takes a photo quickly--the major problem w/ old camera
Neither of us cared for the necessity of charging the battery in the camera and preferred an immediately replaceable battery but it turns out most better quality cameras are of this species so we bought an extra batt to solve that issue
When It Works, it's great
Back to Canon
I have owned two of these, in black and chrome/platinum colors
I took one to China with me in 2010 for a short Thanksgiving trip
I loved the 12x zoom and image stabilization for taking the corners of buildings like the Forbidden Palace
The short videos were excellent quality and meant I didn't need to lug my video camera along
In 2011, I returned for a 45 day trip
Before leaving, I had some trouble with the lens cover closing, probably because of dirt
My more mechanical wife managed to get it closed and I left with the camera
Some time in this process the camera got scratched and glare spots appeared on pictures where light hit the lens
I looked into getting it repaired in China but the prices approached those of a new  camera and the expert shops said they couldn't get the part since it was made for the American market
I limped a long with the camera, taking once in a lifetime pictures with a lens that made it look like the camera had a cataract
I was meeting up with friends in Guangdong so I had my wife buy another of the same model
Once I got it, everything went great for the remainder of the trip
I was very pleased with the results
I went to New Mexico for New Year's
The camera served me well for about 2/3 of the trip, but then the lens started to not close and the display showed a lens error
I can get it to reclose by taking the battery out and in, saying voodoo and sometimes, out of desperation, pushing the lens physically
I haven't dropped or mistreated the cameras, as far as I know
The mechanism does seem very sensitive to dust
I have had a few Canon point and shoots that still operate fine and have never given me any problem
I know Nikon has a reputation for doing better in low light; I found that wasn't the case unless I used the night setting or museum (too slow for children)
When it worked, I loved the S8100
However, I can't go halfway around the world and lose priceless memories to a camera that somehow easily gets scratched or won't operate without doing voodoo
I am looking for another megazoom; it will probably be a Canon
I know it won't be a Nikon
The one I have is still under warranty, but after reading other people's experiences with Nikon service, I don't know if it is worth digging up the receipt and trying to get a replacement
You will find a lot of my S8100 pictures at [
] An example of it at its best is the Oregon Coast pictures at [
]and the scratched lens pictures, many of which were still OK, are at [
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom
Great camera
Much easier to use than my old film-version Nikon of technology from the ancient past
The video that can be taken with this camera is amazingly good, as well as the still photos
Would buy again
Great compact and effective
Lens quality is amazing and a nice wide angle minimum focal length
Pictures come out so clean and clear even in the dark lighting (zero light) at night
Great camera, until it stopped working
I bought this camera 7 days ago
I really liked it and was finally getting into to the point where I could switch back and forth between settings, and could anticipate what setting I'd need for the best picture
I took picture 384 then tried to turn the camera off
I got a lens error and the lens would not retract
I didn't want to force it in, so I tried to power down and back up, but nothing I tried fixed the lens error
I finally ended up returning after I looked a bit online and noticed that this was a common problem
Overall I liked it and wished that it would have worked out
Nikon Coolpix S8100
Great correspondence, prompt service
We have ordered 3 of these camera's
They give great photo quality, it has everything you would need for a great photo
Nikon coolpix
What a great compact camera
Im very happy with this purchase
I bought a kodak camera which I returned because it was terrible and this nikon has been a wonderful replacement
Read all the reviews on cnet and it's definitely recommended
It takes great pictures in low light areas and has a stabilization mobilizer
SUCH a great camera
Photo and screen quality are amazing, zoom is impressive for a compact camera, the navigation wheel is very handy and startup is quick
I get a lot of complements on this camera and questions of "where can I get one?" and it got only a tiny chip when it fell four feet onto concrete
Highly recommended
Great "Multipurpose" and  Small Digital Camera
I am not a professional photographer, I don't even qualify as an "aficionado"
So I decided to upgrade, not to a professional camera, but to a better one
I look for it in Amazon marketplace and the Nikon S8100 is it
I have already received it and, so  far, I am getting great results for both purposes, familiy and work
Very intuitive, great functionality and better yet great quality pictures
Not bad for a non professional or aficionado with a "multipurpose" digital camera
Nikon S8100
Received 5/4/11 & returned 5/5/11
Would not function right out of the box
Got the dreaded "Lens Error" message and it would not work
Tried the "Trouble Shooting" suggestions
still zippo
Will try another brand next time
Enough said
Replacement Camera
This is a replacement of one just like it someone dropped while trying to take our picture
Love the camera
Great compromise
I am an experienced photographer and normally use a full-size DSLR (D300s, D200, etc
) when shooting special projects, but often don't want to take all that gear along when I travel
A couple of years ago I bought a small point-and-shoot (S230) which worked very well when outdoors in good light and was very, very portable, fitting easily into any pocket I had
However, I was unhappy with pictures taken in low-light
Even when I kept the ISO from climbing above 200 and held the camera reasonably steady, low-light pics were usually fairly grainy and/or blurred somewhat due to motion
So when the S8100 came along I decided to try it and am very glad that I did
Performance is exceptional compared to my earlier point-and-shoot (although the sensor size is identical), daylight pics are great, and the low-light problems that I was experiencing with the older S230 have disappeared
The compromise is that it is a little larger but still fits into the front pocket of my Levis (it will fit in my shirt pocket also, but its weight makes it a little uncomfortable there)
Although I am primarily a still photographer, I have tried the video on several occasions and find that works well also
It all depends what you're looking for, of course, but if you want something that takes very, very good pictures but for whatever reason you can't handle the weight and size of the DLSR, this camera is an excellent compromise
BEST Digital handy
Hey, guess what?
the only point and shoot that satisfy your photography
I got this for my road trip, and it's fabulouuuusss
Yep, TRUE
the HD is so TRUE [used it for almost anything] The built in mic is no good, but with external mic, you'll get an awesome video in HD
No other point and shoot can top this camera
Get it and you won't be sorry
Oh, get it from Amazon too bc it's way cheaper
;)
Lens Error Strikes Again
I really love the size, feel and capabilities - excellent zoom and functions, but after only about 7 weeks of use, this camera lens locked and I got the "lens error" message - while on the second day of my vacation in Austria
Sent to Nikon and I'm still waiting after a month in their shop
In the meantime, I've missed having the camera for my family vacation - ugh
I suspect they have a backlog on the the part as this appears to be a common problem
Really want to like Nikon but not sure I can buy from them again
Poor camera choice, stick to cannon, kodak, or sony
After doing much research I picked this camera to replace my kodak easy share that I got in 2008
The image quality is not good at all if there is any kind of motion in the picture
The focal point looks okay but anyone around it who is even moving ever so slightly, will appear blurry
I would not recommend this camera
I plan on exchanging it
Great Point & Shoot Camera
To start off I wish I was able to give it 4
5 stars
I won't waste time with too in depth of a review as there are already plenty of them
This is a great compact point and shoot camera
The image quality is amazing, and more importantly the focus time is much quicker than most cameras in this category
I did adjust a few of the setting for the auto mode to get increased consistency and more true to life images
The main adjustment to make is in the resolution, the default is 1080, I moved it to 1080*
I also upped the rgb one notch toward red as well as the vividness it one or two notches depending on lighting
I mention the settings I have changed because it seems like people complaining about fuzzy images simply do not know how to use even a basic point and shoot camera
The only fuzzy images I have gotten were from testing the continuous shooting mode, and once I learned how to use the mode correctly I got great images with it
The only complaint I have with this camera is the video
The video itself is fantastic and crisp with smooth playback
The issue is with the audio
It clearly picks up all of the tick tick sounds of the the lens as it focuses
It is VERY noticeable and renders the beautiful looking video just about useless
Since like most people I got the camera for the still images this is a minor annoyance but still enough to keep it from being perfect
Though it is still better (yes even the audio) than the Flip (any generation) or Kodak Zi8 & Zi10 for video
Disappointing
Researched cameras before deciding to buy this one, and expected a lot
Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the photo quality
Poor color accuracy, just average sharpness
I have a 5-year-old Canon that cost a third as much as this NIkon, but gives me better photos
Lots of bells and whistles, but lacking in photo quality
what a dissapointment
First, i realized that your finger gets in the way when you hold the camera, so your flash wont pop up
I read that in other reviews but thought it would be worth it if I was careful
Then the flash cover (plastic) fell off because it is only glued on, and in Mass we have humidity and heat
the glue simply didnt hold
I delt with it because the shots were good and I spent 250
less than a year, so many issues OMG really? I have had cheapos from walmart lasting 20 years, I also own $2000 cameras and never an issue, btw they are canon's, but wanted a small light weight camera and nikon was suppose to be good
going back to canon
im so disgusted and after reading nikon help center reviews I now know not to bother even calling
I also looked at the newer model just out of curiousity
ugly to boot
I like it
Great camera, good price
Very easy to use, features are intuitive, menus are simple but give you a lot of options if you want to get creative
It takes excellent point & shoot pictures just using all the defaults (it seems to be smarter than I am)
We used it for my Mom's Christmas card photo and they turned out really nice
Good color & contrast, even with piles of snow
I also used it for night portraits and they turned out fine, too
Only complaint is the weird little flash that pops up under your fingers, but that's not a big deal once it's open
It seemed to recharge quickly using an electrical outlet but took a couple hours using the USB plugged into a laptop
It's also easy to download photos - software was easy to install and easy to use
again intuitive
I'm happy and I'd get it again
*******As an update nine months later
a friend got this same camera (from Best Buy) and it quit working properly within about a month
The internal memory seems to be defective which makes it go wacky
Mine is still fine and I've taken thousands of photos and some video
I put in the extra memory chip, tho
Great camera
I have only had it a couple days but I love it
Easy to work
I've taken several videos with it and it was simple to do
It shipped fast
Only thing I'm not to happy about it the cover for where you plug in the cord for charging
It seems kind of flimsy and probably will not last
Newly acquired
Just recently purchased this camera and was excited about using it but had problems with this at my daughters wedding
Sometimes the camera would be able to show me my existing pictures and other times it would not
Too early to fully rate this camera yet but a little dissatisfied
To get some decent pictures from our vacation I order the Disney photos, which could have paid for a new camera
:(I just recently sent it in, after I dropped it and the lens wouldn't retract
If I never see it again, I won't be disappointed
If they do fix it, I'll give it to my kids and let them play with it
It's just not worth it
I'm just disappointed that it was hyped so much and it doesn't hold up to its name
I think I'll stick to Canon's from now on (my two Canon SLRs (film and digital)still work beautifully)
Random errors
My fiancee and I were very happy about buying this camera after doing our research
We purchased it at our local retailer and had a good experience with it
That is, until it started saying "Mode dial is not in the proper position
" I'm not sure what this error means, but we couldn't use the camera
Of course this happened right after the warranty expired, and Nikon's website said they could fix it for a price
For $300 you'd think that the camera would last longer
Poor experience overall
Really great little camera
I bought my wife one after she lost her camera somewhere
We both liked it so much that I bought another one for myself
Small, easy-to-use, takes great photos and is relatively easy to transfer to a PC
We love this camera
Blah camera
Okay, here's what I hate about this camera:Pros:1) When it takes a good shot it takes a good shot
It's really high rez
2) Much better in low light than a $100 cheaper camera I bought
3) High video resolution
4) It is a battery eater
5) I can't get the battery to last more than 35 minutes
Second, it doesn't come with a separate battery charger, so, if you have a spare battery, you have to use the camera to charge it, which is not as convenient
6) It labels videos as "images" so that when you want to replay or delete them, it's confusing, and you might accidentally delete a video thinking it's an image
7) There is no battery bar on the screen nor in the menu, I've yet to see it after using this cam many times
It doesn't even give you a numerical percentage anywhere
All you get is a fleeting warning before the battery dies
I'm guessing they did this on purpose so people wouldn't realize what a battery hog this thing is
8) As for "plenty of options", a cheap FUJI cam had more options than this thing
It didn't have white balance meter, but still much more versatile than this thing
9) The resolution at high zoom and ability to take pictures in low light is excellent, BUT, unfortunately, if you want a clear picture in low light, you have to hold it pretty still, so the image stabilization is still weak
Also, it uses a high powered light to gauge the target apparently, so it's not stealthy
And another thing about stealth:10) This is a noisy camera, and there is no option to lower the volume of the beeping or turn it off
And when u record video in low light, it makes a movie shutter sound, which can lead to it breaking bcuz I hit it  repeatedly thinking something was jammed
11) Garbage autofocus in video mode, I think pressing the take a photo button brings it in to focus though, sorry I forgot the name of that thing, strange, I know
If they worked these problems out, gave it 30 more minutes of life, and gave it an infrared or radio remote, this would be a great camera, sadly though, I can only recommend it as a great starting camera for kids, or as a high resolution backup camera with video capability
As for the kit, Cameta ripped me off: the little tripod reeks this nasty WD40 smell I've smelt in many cheap electronics which causes headaches and nausea, STRONG nausea, the cheap secondary battery died in days, and they wouldn't give me a return shipping label
If u can get this kit cheap, or camera, like for $170, then yeah u have yourself a deal
Still learning some things
I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this camera
There were certain features I knew I wanted but didn't know if I could get them all in the same camera
at a price I could afford
This camera has it ALL and more
It wouldn't be fair of me to leave a "full" product review yet since I'm still learning about some of the features on the camera
I can tell you that the 1080p video is amazing
The photo quality is excellent
I can't wait to take it off of "Auto" mode and try some of the other settings
It's not the smallest camera in the world so don't expect to go unnoticed if you put it in your pocket
Long story short - I am supremely happy that I bought this camera
Nikon does have a newer model out (Coolpix S9100) but I didn't see the point in spending the extra money, especially since the differences between the 2 models are minimal
Nikon s8100
I have used this camera for about two weeks now and I love this camera
This picture and video quality are superb
Lens quality is amazing with a 10x (300m) zoom and a nice wide angle 30m minimum focal length
Quick to turn on and take a picture or just a moment pause before starting video capture
This is the workhorse of a point and shoot camera
You can also take pictures during videoing
This camera is a bit bulkier than the average compact camera, but worth the size due to all the features
I can still put the camera in my pocket without too much bulk
Recommend a SD card with at least a class 4 rating (the 1080p is a a lot of data to write)
I like the fact that I can just plug the camera into the charger instead of removing the battery all the time
Highly recommend this camera
Software Defect
12-1-10:  The S8001 has a defect in the firmware
Nikon has an update (version 1
1) for it on their website, but you have to buy a SD card reader/writer and implement the fix with a computer yourself
I consider this a major inconvenience that prospective buyers should be aware of
I am told by Nikon that cameras currently being manufactured will have the new updated firmware, but that those on the market now will need the fix
Keep the camera
Throw away the magnetic case
I wanna go shoot something
With the camera that is
I have had it about 40 days and am still in love with it
It feels great in my XL hands
The finish feels like it is rubberized or something
There is a thumb grip in the upper right hand corner to help not drop it
Dropping cameras is bad
That is why the instructions tell you to PUT THE STRAP ON YOUR CAMERA
)Of course I love the 1080 video shooting, but it eats up alot of memory, so you will need a SDHC card or two
I'm using a 16GB Class 10 card
and I don't shoot much video
Besides, 720p video is plenty of resolution for me
12 mp pictures will not fill up alot of space compared to 1080 video, so if you don't shoot video, the 4 GB card that came with it should be sufficient
In VIDEO mode the ZOOM is very gentle, like at 1/4 regular speed
The motor noise is hardly noticable
Some people want to complain about the noise
Hey Guys, The thing has a MOTOR that works the zoom
It isnt that loud
It makes you look like a PRO Videographer
This camera does great with the flash off of grabbing the image better and with more detail than you can see with your eyes
I haven't done many people shots with flash yet , so I cannot comment of reports of the flash washing out subjects
If it washes out, Move Back,and Zoom In a little to Compensate
Photography has always been about compensating and adjusting
I have determined that if you use this camera in flash mode, you have to remember to open the flash before you shoot by depressing the shutter halfway, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO ANYWAY TO SET THE FOCUS
Once the flash is open, it's easy to remember where not to place your finger and cover the flash
Sometimes it is slow to focus in real dark scenes
If it cant focus it flashes a red parentheses around the subject and doesnt shoot
When it figures out the range the parentheses turns green
The zoom is great, and the auto focus works better than any point and shoot that I've seen
I love the great, awesome 3 inch 921,000 dot high resolution screen
So detailed as you review your work, I can even see how good my pictures are without having to use my laptop
BEFORE I removed the protective film on the screen, I used some Xylol with a Q tip to rub the lettering off, and left the film on
It didn't hurt anything, and left the protective film on the screen,quite invisible
I was able to drag the manual off the CD ROM into a new file on my desktop, so I don't have to use the CD to read it
It wasn't hard to do, even for a non-techie
The VIDEO EDITING  software that comes with it is very good
Battery life seems to be very good as I have been using it
I bought an external charger with two batteries off EBAY for $10
so I can charge a battery without it being in the camera, which seems to be an issue with some users
I read some negative reviews about the service dept
and am optimistic that I won't be one that has to go that route
Bottom line is I AM VERY HAPPY with this camera
The only thing I don't like is the case with the magnetic clasp
THROW THE CASE AWAY
PROTECT YOUR CAMERA
Best compact I have seen on the markte
I spent a lot of time reviewing compact cameras prior to settling on this one
(maybe in a few years?)So, I wanted a camera that could deal with low light, shoot fast, start up fast, shoot again fast, and be around 200 bucks
This was the only camera I played with that met the criteria
And the more I play with it, the better it gets
First thing you'll notice - this camera can deal with low-light like no other compact camera
Sure, a DSLR (who's lens would cost more than this camera
) will do a better job
but I managed to get a clear picture at night with no light except for that from a tv on the opposite side of a large room
You can get crisp, beautiful pictures in low lit restaurants without flash (provided little movements on your subjects part) free hand
The fast shooting takes some getting used to
Read the manual, you'll learn a bit about the options (still have to figure what the 16 panel speed shot mode is about)
The have some great options that allow you to shoot 1mp at 120 fps, or 12mp at a decent rate
There is even the (very useful) option of a slower continuous shot mode
Great for getting a quick series shot, instead of a burst of shots (good for getting a single shot of a quick moment)
The start up time on this is amazing
You can have it up, running and zoomed in all the way in just about a second
Shooting won't take much more time
Recylce time for most modes is a bit slow, but if you leave your camera on continuous mode, you can get that second shot off almost instantly, provided you don't need the flash
The flash is the downside to this camera
At times its a bit bright (so you really have to play with settings)
The location makes for awkward shooting (its right where everyone would hold the camera)
However, having it raised, and over the lens does reduce red eye
And, if you don't want the flash on (I avoid using it on this camera), holding your finger over the flash means you'll never be surprised by the flash going off unintentionally
The other downside is the video: It does take good video quality, but the mic picks up the zoom and auto focus
If there is a lot of ambient noise, and you're careful about this, you won't notice
They also slowed the zoom speed down (to reduce noise?)
but I would rather have it be noisy and fast, just to have access
You can just not zoom, and lock the AF to fix this problem
Also, the set up for switching between high speed etc is not really intuitive, I'm still working on playing with that
Awesome lay out of buttons: record for video is a hard button that can be used in any mode
You can also shoot stills while recording
I don't know why the nav keys can both spin and be pressed
I actually find it annoying, but got used to it quickly (now I just don't spin it all)
Everything else is pretty standard
The lens protrudes a little, so this 'compact camera' is a bit bulkier (the lens also adds a bit of weight) than its peers, but for 10x zoom and the quality of pictures its a fair trade off
So, over all, best compact camera I've seen
ever
For this price, I cannot complain
Sure, it has a few things that could be better (more control over continuous burst speed, slow down the shot speed on the 16 shot mode, better video setting controls, maybe put the flash 1/4 of an inch to over) but if they fixed all that, it would probably sell for 400 bucks
and I'd be tempted to pay that much
Great camera, good price
I bought this camera as a replacement for my wife's Kodak Easy Share
I decided to go with the Nikon as we already own a D60 and love it
After reading several reviews that talked about poor image quality, especially low light images, I was hesitant to buy
In the end I decided to go with the Nikon and I was not disappointed
The image quality is great
The camera is easy to use and has loads of features
My wife loves the camera
The camera is a great size and fits in her purse/pocket
She never reads the instruction manuals for any of our electronics, but picked it up and started using it day 1 w/o issue
I love the camera
It has tons of extra features for a p&s; and it the perfect companion to my D60
If you enjoy "tweaking" settings this camera allows plenty of room to experiment
The camera is responsive and is able to photograph kids at play w/o trouble
Finally, some people complained about background noise while recording video at 1080p
I haven't noticed any noise and have taken about 20 hours of video
If you're looking for a mid priced p&s; with great image quality then I would recommend this camera
Great camera so far
I have owned quite a few digital cameras over the last ten years
All have taken nice pictures in well lit situations
The challenge has always been low light and indoors
I also found the controls annoying, but would have lived with it if it took good pics
I then looked at this camera
It's a bit bulky, but I like how it feels in my hands
The LCD screen is amazing
The zoom is great
It takes fantastic indoor pics
Low light is very good for a compact, but don't expect miracles
You can get great deals on this camera since the 9100 came out which is basically the same camera with more zoom
I haven't tried video yet
I love this camera
Nikon Coolpix S8100 is totally cool
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
0-Inch LCD (Black)Great features and amazing flexibility
HD makes it a step above many others along with facial recognition and low light/nighttime controls
10X zoom is wonderful
No suggestions for improvement
Love it
I did a lot of research on cameras before purchasing this one
I wanted a DSLR, but didn't have the money for one
We just had a baby and wanted a good camera to capture memories, and we made the right choice
This takes amazing quality photos on auto mode, has lots of settings
The pop up flash hasn't been a problem for me, but I can see how it would irritate some people
The only thing is when we ask other people to take pictures of our family for us, the pop up flash can be hard if people don't know about it/aren't used to it
But otherwise, this camera is great
I highly recommend it
Great camera that I`ve ever seen
I was looking for a camera a long time ago, but I didn't know wich one to buy
I was looking for a camera with a great quality in the pictures and videos, pretty color and a camera that I could put in my purse
After a long research I think I did the BEST choice
This camera is AMAZING, my friends have other kind of cameras and all of them said that my camera is amazing and has a great quality
Totally true
I asked to one guy take a picture of us and he couldn`t believe how good was the camera and he asked me where I bought it
I went at Radio City Music Hall, in NYC, watching Madagascar Live, and I sat in the 3r floor, so far than stage, I put the zoom and I could see the face (all the details in their face) of the people and with my own eyes I couldn`t
I am really pround of my choice, this is more that I expected, but the camera is large and a little heavy comparing with the others, but I think is because the zoom
Anyway, I liked this camera, is a beautiful color (I have in red) and I am not professional but I can take good pictures with it
I bought this camera at amazon
com because was cheapper comparing with the other websites and you will receive a pretty cool case in leather for it
Exceeded my expectations
This is a great little point and shoot camera
It has many features and digital video recording at 1080
Pictures look great on big flat screen TV's
It comes loaded with goodies
And has more than enough settings to capture the image in many differnt lights and you can edit on the camera
Great Value
Garbage
This is the second Nikon camera i bought in the past 6 months
The first was the L810, I didn't like that one because my images were getting scrambled when i used the review function so I was pissed but decided to give Nikon a second chance and bought the S8100
owned this camera for roughly 3 months and now its not working I keep getting a lens error and the camera has never been dropped
Sometimes it comes on and won't even show anything on the screen
Straight garbage i won't buy another Nikon product any time soon
Great little camera
I bought this camera about 6 months ago to have something more portable then my D-SLR, and it has went beyond my expectations for a point and shoot camera
This camera has survived 6 months in the harsh desert environment of Afghanistan, even survived getting blown up without any problems
The reason I gave it 4 stars is night shooting isn't what I would like it to be, the camera case sometimes opens up on the top, and the battery is very poor even more so if for any reason you use the flash I highly recommend getting a backup battery for it
A side note for the camera it does not work with SDXC cards, I tried my 64GB card and it would not register it, but a 16GB card works great
Top Notch Camera
This camera is well worth the price
excellent pictures and video
I used it (for 1st time) at my son's college graduation with excellent results
This camera is highly recommended
Our first good camera
It's been a great purchase
Super photos on a recent trip
The flash pops up where you put your finger, but you get used to it
I highly recommend this model
Great photo quality, but durability sucks
I write this review with mixed feelings
On one hand, when my S8100 worked it was a nice camera
The photo quality was top notch
It takes really clear pictures with nice color balance and tones
The flash quality is good too
And the HD video (720p) is very good for a camera of this size
I also liked the zoom lens - it works well
I had heard good things about Nikons and I made the switch when my wife lost our little Canon point and shoot
So I went for this one, hoping that I would see a dramatic improvement
The pictures certainly told a more vivid story
But the reliability of this camera SUCKS
This camera has broken twice on me
The first time I had owned the camera less than a week
We took it on vacation with us and on the 3rd day I got a "lens error"
The camera would not turn off or retract the lends
I couldn't use it the entire trip
I had to send it back to Nikon for repair, which they did because it was still covered by warranty
Now six months later the lens error has happened again
I am done with Nikon products
I will return to using Canon cameras as they are more durable and of higher quality
Unacceptable Reliability
My Nikon S8100 failed on the second day of use after about 20 shots with a fatal lens error
The lens wouldn't retract and the power stayed on with a "Lens Error" message on the screen
Taking the battery out as to try reset it didn't work
I am positive the lens wasn't bumped while it was extended so it is just an unreliable mechanism
This is really too bad because the camera has so many great features and works for 95% of the photos I want to take
This camera replaced an S8000 I got a little more than a year ago that has most of the identical features and it took great photos too until the lens wouldn't retract with the same "Lens Error" message
Since it is just past the one year warranty, it too is junk
My S8100 is being returned to Amazon for a refund as I have to give up on Nikon
This is really too bad, but their reputation is shot
The failure of this S8100 was also at a very bad time as it is at the beginning of time with grandsons from the Mid West
Since I loved the quality of photos of the S8000, I thought the S8100 might have better quality besides some upgrades tot eh focal plane, better dark performance, etc
, so I purchased one anyway even with all the bad luck others have had with this camera
I can now say with first hand information, that Nikon is now making JUNK
Thus, the one star as there isn't a zero star rating
Great point and shoot
crystal clear photos
All is good with this camera except for the usb, battery and hdmi outlets
The plastic cover for these outlets is very flimsy and feels like it's going to break off everytime they are moved to plug a cable in
Minor cosmetic flaw that does not affect the performance of this great digi cam
Spend three times the price and maybe it might be better
Maybe
Nikon S8100This camera is a pleasure to review and I can't say enough to describe what a superb instrument it is to use
As kind of a hobby, and to get out of the house for a little exercise for my 78 year old frame, I go to a number of stores to shop on a daily basis, mostly 7 days per week
This explains why I can say I traveled to at least 15 stores over several months to demonstrate, test and fondle, easily, 50 cameras
I narrowed the choices between the following; Olympus VR2, Sony''', Samsung""", Nikon S8100, Cannon'''
(And that was the narrowed part)The Olympus had all the right specs
great very wide and long angle telephoto lens
it didn't feel particularly sturdy, the screen images were not crisp as I thought they should be, too many negative write-ups by people that were expert in the field (which I am not)
Good price
came close on this one
Sony had great (most important to me) wide angle lens, good telephoto and the very great sweep panorama feature, pretty good screen images, BUT I was astounded how cheap and toy-like the unit felt to me in my hand
maybe because it is all plastic
anyway, I could not get passed it
I thought not having the great very wide angle lens and the sweep panorama was ending my photography career
I was wrong
I liked the Samsung touch screen a lot but I have been hearing about far too many problems with touch screen camera so this one went down the tube after a short short
The Cannon was OK but lacked some of the items of interest
so I passed on it
Then came the S8100 Nikon ; Built like a brick,
it appears it would survive a truck driving over it
all metal, but light enough and sized right to slip into a shirt pocket
You will know it is there, but it is not bothersome
Attractive and nicely finished, plus the weight and heft in general is perfect for me as it lets me know I have something in my hand that I can control
The lens and screen are clear as a bell, the telescopic movement is swift, the video is marvelously simple to start and stop, viewing the video is clear and the sound is super
The panorama assist is great and provides a better scene than the sweep panoramas I tested
the panorama photos are flawlessly stitched and consistent due in part to the Panorama 5 software that comes with the camera
Low light shots were surprisingly clear and sharp as well
Some of the picky reviews I read tells me these guys are clueless operators or have a malfunctioning unit (It happens to the best)I admit it took me some head-scratching to understand both of the photo programs that arrived in the camera box for loading into the computer
I got it now though
I was also perplexed at the menu manipulation and understanding what the camera was telling me it could do
once the light went off in the brain it became a very simple task; however; I did think that all was lost the first time around
Now as I operate everything I can't understand what it was that was so complicated for me
I printed out the online manual which yielded 204 pages
this should give you an idea of the capabilities of the camera
The manual is excellent and well constructed
SO in the end, would I buy again?
Absolutely
My mechanically deficient wife is using it so much that I believe I will have to get another for myself
hard to go wrong with this machine
I hope this long winded review was of some help
Great zoom, very good Continuous
I've posted several photos at this Amazon camera link for people to view that demonstrate the features most important to me
There are 2 pictures with an Airstream trailer, one at no zoom, the other at 10x zoom
That zoom is amazing
Fantastic clarity and detail (even when I zoom in on my computer)
The continuous shooting is not as good as my DSLR, but still very acceptable
I added a couple of photos of my cat and golden retriever taken in the continuous mode (12MP*)
These photos demonstrate shots from very slow motion up to very fast motion
I printed a few shots as 8
5 x 11, and the printed pictures came out extremely clear
I'm still testing it out, but so far its definitely a keeper
Excellent Purchase/Excellent Seller
At first, I was concerned that this little camera would be what I was looking for to use
However, after having been using it often and seeing such wonderful results, I am very satisfied and happy
It was recommended by a friend for the type of photographer that I am and it is exactly as described
The seller had it to me very quickly and I am extremely satisfied with their packaging and quality of product
looks nice, works OK
I have used the Nikon S8100 for 3 months
It could be a GREAT camera with the following: variable speed zoom, manual aperatue and manual shutter speed, and a viewfinder for those sunny days
Instead, it is a nice looking but fairly vanilla point and shoot
The zoom is nice
I don't mind the slighly large size
I don't mind the flash position that everyone seems to dislike
The macro is fantastic in camera and movie mode and I would say that plus the zoom are the camera's best features
Come on -- please --somebody build a high quality small format for the days the SLR can't go
Today, I am sending to repair shop - lens will not retract
Fantastic point & shoot
I have owned this camera for about 3 months now and so far it is the best point & shoot camera I have owned and I have owned several
The picture quality is fantastic
The low light shooting is great for a point & shoot
You just need to learn about the camera and what the different scenes and adjustments do
The LCD screen is one of the best I have ever seen and is of high quality
The 10x zoom is very good although I would like to have seen from a 12 to 15, but then the picture quality may have suffered
The build quality is great
It feels like a high end camera and doesn't have that cheap plastic feel
I also like the fact it has a HDMI port
The video is very good although not great
The biggest problem with the video is that you can hear the noise of the zoom when you zoom in & out during video shooting
It's not a deal breaker and it's not that bad, but just be aware that you can hear the zoom
The other 2 things that I'm not happy with, is the charging system and no manual mode
There are plenty of adjustments to get great pictures and I guess if you want more adjustments then maybe you should think about a DSLR
The charging system means you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it
Why Nikon didn't include a stand a lone charger with this camera is beyond me
But I found a charger with a car adapter and a 2nd Nikon battery for only $26 here on Amazon so that takes care of that
I've read where some were having problems with blurry pictures
I have had no problems with that at all
Again, the picture quality is fantastic for a compact point & shoot
It starts up quick and is very quick between shots
Which is a result of the CMOS sensor it has which is also why it is good in low light conditions
I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point & shoot that takes fantastic pictures, and has pretty good video capabilities with a good zoom, and is well built that will fit in your pocket
Absolutely PHENOMENAL
I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know my way around a camera
I've never owned a compact camera anywhere near as fantastic as this camera
Every single thing it does is a mini miracle
The zoom is seamless and it focuses faster and clearer throughout the entire range than many SLR lenses I've used
The new sensor is unbelievable
A sign of a good camera is its capability to take pictures in the dark
That's something I always look for when buying a new camera
This camera has new technology for its "night portrait" mode
It actually takes a picture without flash (so as to capture the light behind you) and then takes a flash picture
It then combines the two shots giving a true to life image of the the person and background
You can't tell that it takes two pictures because it all only takes the time of a normal flash picture
Same goes for "night landscape" mode
I tested it by taking a flash-free picture of my kitchen at night with all of the lights in the house off
In the photo, you can actually see the oven and refrigerator and even read the clock on the oven and microwave
And it's not even noisy (grainy)
It has many advanced features for a compact, such as the ability to view a histogram and to look at the information of pictures you've already taken, like the ISO sensitivity used
Very handy if you like how a picture turned out and want to try to repeat the results
And then there's the video
While I mainly bought this camera for its photo capabilities, there is no denying that this little guy makes fantastic videos
Extremely clear and realistic
The sound could be a bit better, but it's certainly not bad enough to complain
If you're recording something silent, you can hear the zoom a little, but isn't that true with all video cameras?  This camera also has a great feature for slow motion videos
I've never been so amused as I have been while trying to find things to record in slow-mo
So, in summary
The photos are crystal clear and true to color
The new night shooting capabilities are the absolute best I've seen in a compact camera
It has 10x optical zoom plus around 4x digital
And it records full 1080p HD video
AND it's all in a cute little compact package
How can you beat that?Oh, and the color of the red camera is the most gorgeous shade of red I've ever seen
The photo here definitely doesn't do it justice
If you decide to buy one of these cameras, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
Good photo quality, nice zoom
We've had this for almost a year now and the photo quality has been very good
Have been using it for wildlife and birds recently and the zoom makes for some great photos
Very easy to operate for someone with dexterity issues or large hands
Top Camera
My wife enjoys taking videos when we travel
The Nikon Coolpix S8000 we have is a bit limited for that use
We got the S8100, and she now gets amazing videos, with which we both are pleased
Great Features but flash pictures are HORRIBLE
I have gone through over 10 different point and shoot cameras over the past 13 years
I probably bought the first Sony digital camera that recorded on floppy discs for $500 in 1997
It weighed 2 pounds but had a beautiful lens
NOT even 1080 x 800 resolution
This Nikon S8100 is great camera and does great 1080P videos in every aspect except for 2:1) the FLASH photos shots are almost ALL overexposed and look HORRIBLE
2) the controls are NOT intuitive and are semi difficult to useI bought this camera in December 2010 and if I had to decide again, I would have / should have bought the more intuitive Cannon
Very bad for video
I bought  this camera for the convenience of the video, but has been a dissapointment so far, I have sent it twice for repair (for me is a defect of this model, but check it out before you buy)
It takes good pictures, but when recording video, it goes out of focus as soon as the focus is moving (in or out), and in a lot of cases it will not regain focus, the service department has giving me excuses and do not admit that the camera has a problem, that's why I recomend to check more reviews in regards of video before buying it, if you just want to take pictures, get a cheaper camera with the same capabilities as this one, you'll save alot
I tried to be positive, but
Overall, a wonderful camera with excellent quality photos, great zoom, good size, CMOS chip allows for awesome night shots (for better visibility only
Beware
See comment number 4 below
) I also like the separate video button, rather than having to select "video" on the dial then press record
Critiques:1) Flash is in a weird spot - placed right where I would steady the camera with my non-dominant hand
But I quickly got used to it and trained myself to place my hand elsewhere
2) Flash can easily wash out the subject if you are too close
3) Have to change the battery IN the camera
So the camera becomes unavailable during that time
I understand you can buy a separate battery-charger
for more $$$ of course
Or if you are on vacation and wish to use it every day, just prepare ahead of time by buying a spare battery and make sure both are charged every night so that you have fresh fully-charged batteries come morning
4) BIGGEST COMPLAINT BY FAR:  Although the camera takes great pictures in in dimly lit rooms in terms of visibility (awesome nightshot of an old town street in exas - looks like it was still dusk), but the camera is a horrific disaster when it comes to clarity
Blur blur blur blur blur
I've gotten used to grainy pictures in dimily lit rooms (and ironically this camera does a wonderful job at improving that, so that it's usually a non-issue
) But that benefit is completely eliminated by the fact that the pictures are blurry
Not soft
blurry
Did I mention the pictures in a dimly-lit room come out blurry?  I had to return it
Don't care how good the pictures are when you use the camera in the sun
I cherish all shots in all locations at all times, and the camera's inability to take even relatively-clear pictures has made the camera useless to me
FYI: I've read reviews that some were able to pseudo-compensate via manual controls, but when the moment is there, you want to capture it quick
right?  Also, some may "gently" suggest that I quit whining and splurge on a DSLR or something - and I would agree - but I've seen pictures from a point-n-shoot Canon SX120 of kids in dimly lit rooms and they came out sharp every time
great portable camera w/ awesome video
I had a larger more professional 7mp camera in the past and found myself leaving it behind when I went places with my wife and kids
This camera does the trick at portability and takes great pictures for a hand-held pocket sized camera
My wife likes the point and shoot without thinking part and I feel it has enough shooting modes and settings that I can take professional quality pictures
The camera starts up fast and is quick from shot to shot
The screen is bright and clear and the movie feature is easy to use and takes awesome video
Amazing
I have never owened a better camera
The battery life is great, the picture quality is great, it is a complete package
I will never buy another brand again
I have used cannon and kodak and I have to say this camera is by far the easiest to use
I am no professional photographer so I am happy I can get a grat picture with the touch of a button and I don't have to play with the settings or anything
Good Camera for the price
Overall, it is a fairly good camera for the price
The only complain I have is that the camera is not suitable for fast moving objects like sports
Other than that, I'm very happy with it
Well worth the money
I wanted a digital point and shoot that I could use in the place of my bulky Canon SLR
Being a brand loyalist, I started with a Canon Powershot SX130IS
It was terrible
I had read the reviews for this camera on several websites and the only negative thing I read about was the zoom sound in videos
Since I was not going to be using this for videos, I decided to try it
This camera is awesome
I was able to use it to capture my 2 year old son opening Christmas presents, and almost NONE of the photos are blurry, despite the fact that he was moving constantly
The photos are clear and beautiful and the different options are great
Night Photo is amazing
This Nikon has completely changed my mind about the brand and I will be a Nikon loyalist from now on :)
Picturetastic
well worth the money
Comes with multiple settings already programed and easy enough to play with other settings
It took beautiful photos when I was out west in Wyoming
s8100
It was well worth the wait for my red camera
The pictures are coming out very nice
I love the micro zoom which allows me to take excellent detailed pictures of flowers and any small item
It is actually very light and came with a nice leather case
The flash comes up automatically but needs to be manually pressed down to be closed
I saw some reviews where this camera did not need a flash at all in dark environments
In my case, flash comes up whenever there is not enough light unless I turn it off
User manual is not printed, it is on a cd which is a bit of an inconvenience but saves trees :)
Love this camera
SMILE
I am overall pleased with the camera and how easy it is to use
I take a lot of pictures of my granddaughter and she's moving
These are some of her best shots
Great camera for on the go people
Nikon S8100 P&S Camera
This camera takes crisp quality pictures
As compared to other point and shoot cameras, the quality and detail is hands down better
This is probably due to the actual number of lenses and distance the lenses are able to extend from the camera itself
While reviewing the camera prior to purchase, I noted other people mentioned the placement of the flash
I too would have to agree it is annoying and I often forget to move my fingers as I am not quite used to its location
With that being said, the quality of pictures taken with the flash down are so that a little color/contrast editing bring the pictures back to top quality (sometimes better than other P&S; cameras with a flash)
This also has some bearing on the night or low light pictures taken with the S8100
No issues in this department
Although, if Nikon decides to add a night vision capability to this camera, sign me up
The LCD is crisp and clear but is mounted flush
Being in the military and deployed, this bothers me as I have to continually make a conscious effort to keep the screen from being damaged
The internal memory is descent with about 50 pictures worth of space
Not sure how much video space that is as I have not taken any video yet (therefore have not rated the video in this review)
As of this writing I have only had the camera for about three weeks
With this said, I am impressed at the quality of photo from this camera
Bottom line is you will not be discouraged with this purchase
Well worth the cost
Another lens failure
While it lasted, it was a great little camera
Great for pictures as well as for taking movies on the fly
I like to carry a camera with me at all times and this one was perfect
But it did not last very long before I got the dreaded "lens malfunction"
The equivalent of a "Blue Screen of Death" on Windows operating systems
I have few digital cameras, but this one is the best ever
It is very easy to use and very compact with professional quality pictures
I love it, LOVE IT
I bought it very cheap from AMAZON
COM
I have 16 months old son who i took the best pictures of him with this incredible camera
I recommend this camera for everybody who wants to capture best pictures
So far a GOOD solid VERY SMALL (for 10x) Zoom Auto Point and Shoot - But doesn't over come the laws of physics
(Darn
OK, so I bought this camera from Amazon, great service from them, only had this camera 2 days so this is just a first impression
Usually I wait for the reviews and buy then but the features on this looked good and besides, its Christmas
(almost)
This Nikon s8100 a just a little bigger and heavier (10x Zoom) than the Canon IS1100, 1200, 1300, 1400s (3x Zooms), needs a "slightly" bigger case
Camera startup is reasonably speedy, something less than 3 seconds from start/focus/take picture in low light ( faster outside)
Good enough for me
Very little shutter lag, comparable or better than other good digitals I've owned (Canon A710, 1100is)
Focus is fast and accurate
This is a next gen camera so it should do all of that stuff well and it does
Weight: yes it weighs a little more but feels solid
Guess Nikon hasn't figured out how to make a good  10x zoom lens weigh less than a  gram, darn those guys
Focusing: yes when I zoom in and try to focus closer than the lens physically can get it won't focus (10x has to be something over 10' or so)
Another law of physics Nikon is unable to overcome, darn those guys again
Low light pics: very nice
Low light video also very good, but there is one setting in video the 1080 without the star where the video looks dull
Don't know why, set it on the star 1080(default) and leave it
No manual controls: I didn't buy this for the manual controls (its a point & shoot remember, get your Binford 5000 25pound mucho $$$ rig out for the tricky stuff), I just want to whip it out,  take pictures and video, and it does that well
Pictures and video look very good, better than my other cameras
The video focus will hunt a TINY bit when zooming, but, this camera WILL zoom during video, unlike others
Low light video is good but the more you zoom the less light you get (gee
That's like all my other cameras EVER, and its a 10x zoom, not 3x or 4x) So, video  works  good when you compare zoom distance to light collection
Auto scene mode doesn't pick the right scene indoors in low light (wants to use night landscape), use Regular Auto in that situation
Auto Scene works OK so far otherwise
Flash is good and fairly powerful for a small unit, exposure mostly about right
You just need to hold it differently than other cameras for the flash to pop up on the top left side, one handed pics (for right handers), no problem
Battery life, not as good as others, but OK
Use the USB cable to charge the battery in the camera,  4hrs, OR, get an extra charger and battery and do it that way, you HAVE A CHOICE with the s8100
Oh, BTW, (as others point out) the USB cover FEELs flimsy (I couldn't really care less about this
it works)
Haven't found any large flaws yet
Just get out there and take pictures
Great Compact Camera
My wife and I are very pleased with this compact camera
It takes excellent photos, easy to use, great zoom, and fast
It compliments my Nikon D5000 nicely
Exactly what we were looking for in a reasonably priced high quality compact camera
FlyBoy Seal of Approval
WORST CAMERA EVER
I ordered this camera about 6 months ago
The camera stopped focusing after 1 week
Returned it to Amazon and got a replacement
The same problem appeared with the replacement after a few months
Now the Amazon guarantee is not in effect, and when returned to Nikon, they replied that this is not covered under their guarantee (surely, because this problem happens so often to their cameras that it wouldn't be worth it)
In sum, better buy another brand
Perfect
Perfect camera with a 10X zoom
Still small enough to fit into your pocket
The quality of the pictures are great
Glad I made this purchase
good
works good
second one i bought
needed mine, wife had it when i needed it
takes good pictures for what i needed it for
Nikon Coolpix S8100
I spent a considerable amount of time looking for a camera that I needed for a special use
After going to 4 stores, comparing cameras and prices, I decided to go on Amazon
The price was much lower than the retail stores
More importantly, the camera suits my needs perfectly, takes great pictures
The flash works beautifully, the red eye feature is good, the pictures are very sharp and clear
I received my Nikon quickly, well packaged and exactly as advertised
Very satisfied with the camera and the transaction with Amazon
best camera in its class by far
Since so many of the reviews mention it, I'll start by saying I don't use the video mode, I don't care about the video mode
I have a video camera for video
I was buying a camera solely for still photography, and, if that's what you are looking for, there is no better in this price class
I did extensive research before buying - I had never had anything but a Canon in the point-and-shoot category before
I tried out the comparable Canon and Lumix before deciding on this one
I could not be more pleased
No one does true color better than Nikon, and its AUTO mode is off the charts spot-on, even for difficult shots in weird light with subtle effects (sun pooling through a forest canopy, for example, or dusk on a street as the neon lights come on)
I like a mix of AUTO and manual - this one has it, and manual is extremely easy to call up and use, unlike that mode for the other two brands
The preset modes can also be manipulated to produce high contrast and backlit effects, among others I have yet to fully explore
Indoor flash photography
Amazing
Soooo tired was I of the washed out deer-in-the-headlights effect of the Canon - finally, I take a picture of my dog, and it looks like my dog, you know? It seems a small thing, but hard to find at this price
The zoom is also fantastic - image stabilization works well with this, unlike the Lumix, supposedly the best rated in this category, but in my try-out, irregular at best
Other complaints in reviews have to do with the location of the flash - not a problem for me
I just don't put my finger there - there's no particular reason to do so
The flash quality is such that I am not going to complain about where it's located
My biggest problem with the camera is that I can't find a camera pouch to suit it
Too many of those advertised on amazon
com say they will fit the somewhat more "square" geometry of the S8100 in point-and-shoot pouches designed for the Lumix or Elph
I've sent two back so far - any recommendations on the best bag for the S8100 are welcome
I wouldn't want anything to happen to this camera
I love it
Remarkable low-light performance
So far, so good
Reasonable size (fits in pocket)
Happy with photos -- noted bright, deep colors
Excellent features for low-light photography -- including a double-exposure mode to capture that great sunset with your foreground subjects illuminated with flash
Basic features are intuitive and easily within reach
With extreme shots, only very minor chromatic aberration and have not noted issues blooming
Time from power-on to first shot is good
Rating the 8100
Delivery was on time as promised
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has meet all the promises
It does operate in low light, produces pictures with great fidelity
The zoom works very well
Items to consider are: 1) the flash seems to be a problem since I normall locate one finger over the location of the flash
This has necessitated retaking some pictures where the flash was not fully up
, 2)the camera is more bulky than I would have liked
Recognizing the features this does not seem to be a great problem
3)to take low light pictures without flash I have had to use the continuous feature rather that the low light or party setting which both use flash
All in all it does allow low light photos
Best Compact Point and Shoot
By far the Nikon Coolpix S8100 is the best compact point and shoot I have ever used
I have had Canon and Olympus products and they do not even compare
The automatic mode does it all
It is so easy to use, my wife doesn't have to even think about what to do
She points and shoots and it is perfect, from outdoor action shots to indoor birthday parties in low light
Tough to beat
I typically carry a Canon 40D and a 1DmkII but i wanted something smaller to carry around
Something I wouldnt have to make an insurance claim on if it were lost or stolen
For the features, this camera is hard to beat, the automatic scenes do what they are supposed to quick, and easy
Even the burst shots, HDR and the lowlight shots are quick, you dont even notice how many shots the camera has taken until they process and merge for the final product
Image quality is top notch for a point and shoot
It doesnt have any manual controls so if you are looking for pro features this isnt for you
But if you already have a 4/3rds, or DSLR
this makes a great pocket camera
My only complaint, which ill agree with someone else on
is the flash placement
You wouldnt think it would get in the way, but i find my self often seeing the error "flash not fully raised" because my finger is blocking it
Great Camera
Fantastic camera, I have wanted to buy this camera for some time (my son has one), finally it came down to my price range
Great HD movies, great pictures even at the lower pixels
and does very well in low light
I was in love but now I am not
Two cameras ago I had a Nikon coolpix that was a very good camera (this was about 6-7 years ago)
It ran on batteries so after taking about 1100 pics on a trip around the world I passed it on to a friend who is still using it
I then bought a Panasonic that I used a lot and really liked but after 4 years I thought I could get a better camera
I read this camera's review and I though it was a no-brainer
It is pretty annoying and I'm thinking that pretty soon the flash is going to fall off the camera or break
2) I did not realize soon enough that this camera does not have the option to take black/white pictures or much less sepia, or any other tones
It does not provide you that option on the menu and it does not have
To add insult to injury the software the camera comes with does not offer that either
WTF???Cannot believe Nikon came out with such a bad product
I will say in their favor that the pics are extremely good but the two items above make my experience go sour
Nikon S8100
Have been disappointed with this camera
First Nikon S8100 camera had a defective lens and was replaced by Amazon
Second Nikon S8100 camera takes no better pictures than the Pentax Optio S45 camera that I already have
The Nikon S8100 should come with a written operator's manual rather than a software C/D that has to be viewed on a computer screen
I don't like the battery and battery charger set-up either
Battery life is too short and the battery has to be in the camera for it to recharge
On a scale of 1 to 10,  I would give Amazon a 10 and the Nikon S8100 about a 3
Love the Camera
A Great Camera
Great Price
I thought I was always going to be a Cannon guy, but found out differently
No high-speed-shutter scene mode
I thought I'd thoroughly researched replacement brands/models, and this Nikon S8100 was my best choice
Pros: Terrific form factor, brilliant LCD screen, 10x optical zoom, usual Nikon quality, support, warranty
Cons: No high-speed-shutter scene mode, which makes this unacceptable for my travel camera
The S8100 does most everything else very well though
Edit- I was told wrong by the Nikon rep
You can view your pictures without the lens being extended
This camera is awesome and deserves a 5+ star rating
Lot of research
Love this camera
Great in low light
10x zoom is great for shooting the types of photo's I need to shoot
Easy interface and quick response
Right between the 35mm and the pocket cameras
Nikon S8100
Bought this camera as a refurbished item at a really good price
Am totally happy with it
Was just out in Colorado for 2 weeks and took lots of pictures
They all came out superb
Easy to set up and use
Very portable
exactly what it's purported to be
way cool
this compact Nikon arrived today and it took all of 3 minutes to prepare it and turn it on, which is as quick as claimed
nice, large display, with the flash location not an issue for me at all
I stepped outside and just snapped about 4-5 photos before coming in and downloading
they were really surprising SOOC
I do not plan on using the video feature, other than perhaps on a rare occasion, as I bought it to carry around in inclement weather more than anything, rather than expose the D90 or the D300s to winters elements
It feels very sturdy in my hand
I'll update in 30-45 days if any issues arise, but it is exactly what I felt it should be, and the $$ is fairly set
Great Little Camera
Love it
Easy to use
Got this camera the day before we left on vacation
So simple and we got fantastic pictures in San Diego
My husband thought I was getting way to much confidence in the zoom, but my pictures turned out great especially for a point and shoot
My husband who has never been a picture taker even started taking the camera from me
He took great shots
So happy with the low light pictures too
Wish it had a view finder, but most point and shoots don't
So hard to find the perfect camera, but am real happy with this one
Poor Quality Control, Lousy Customer Service
Purchased camera for Christmas
Camera began to scroll, erratically, at about day 100
Problem continued; contacted Nikon at about day 110
Sent camera to Nikon, Nikon claims camera is `damaged'(100 images, maybe, max, since holiday
Nikon will not cover under warranty, wants $100 to repair a $200 camera, that's approx 4 months old
DON'T BUY ONE
This is NOT your father's/grandfather's camera/camera company
electrobrand lies, gives 0 custromer service, they just don't care
Nikon s8100
I really loved the camera
My photos are getting incredible
It's easy to make the photos
the photos looks very natural
Coolpix S8100 camera
This is a versitle camera and you can adjust the setting to take what ever kind of pictures you want
Drawbacks are as follows1- The HD movie you take its only good for downloading to PC and can only be watched in low definitation with direct cble to TV (no HDMI or component cable included)
The only way to see your movie in High definition is to burn it into a Blueray DVD (expensive option)
2- Lighting is not automatically set and after you take the picture you will find out if the brightness needs to be adjusted
3- Battery is charged through USB cable and if you get spare battery it requires swapping back and forth (Battery life is not good either)I am thinking of returning this camera eventhough I like Coolpix over Sony or Cannon but I think there are set backs on this one
Great camera / value
This camera takes quality pictures for its price point
It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and the controls & setup are easy to navigate
A great buy
Nikon Coolpix S8100
Great little camera
Easy to use
Light to carry
Big 3
0 inch view
Photos have nice clarity
Simple to use the camera's many functions
the instruction sheet is in very fine print
i have not got around to reading the instructions, the fine print is hard to see,i have a  best friend that has one so will get him to get me started
Smart Camera
I am so impressed with this camera
This is the first Nikon camera I've bought - as I have owned a digital sony and cannon in the past
But, based on the reviews from consumer reports Nikon was a top camera so I thought I would try it out
So far, my experiences have been super
The camera is so smart - is has a "Smile" feature that only when the subjects are smiling will it take
And, with 3 kids - this is important because I waste a lot of shots
The camera even recognizes how many people are in the frame by placing a square over each face to focus
It is sleek & easy to use
I'm still trying to figure out the other features because there is so many
So far, it is the most impressive camera I've owned
Beware of SD card compatibility
Just now able to use my new camera after waiting a few days to go buy another card so the camera would work
I ordered 2 Transcend 8g and 4G class 6 cards with camera
Neither of these Transcend cards or any of the other 4 SD cards I already had would work in the camera
The screen would show the error code "this card write protected"
I tried all the cards with the (card) slide switches in both positions and the S8100 would not function, only with it's built-in internal memory
I contacted Nikon's helpsite and they said I must use only the recommended cards
I went out and bought a SanDisk card and the camera finally accepted it without error
I was not happy that the camera would not accept any of my 6 cards
They should INSIST in their literature that you must use their short list of 4 SD cards
(SanDisk, Toshiba, Panasonic and Lexar)
Great camera if youre looking for a hybrid between DSLR and Compact
I received this camera for Christmas and love it
It is really nice and pretty compact for the amount of zoom it offers
It is also really quick (start up and shutter speed)
It takes excellent pictures and the video quality is really stunning
Uploading them to the computer is a breeze too
Perfect Balance of Zoom and Quality
After extensive testing with some of the different settings I can tell you the camera exceeds in many areas
If you aren't overly concerned with printing pictures of larger size this camera will fit your needs
The sharpness even at full zoom is great and the noise level isn't bad at all
] 1 great example of the video quality and zoom quality of wildlife
another amazing example of the low light quality in videos
Com but I felt the need to express how amazing this camera is
A good, good, good (bridge) camera
I am not going to write a lot about specs because they are fully listed at Panasonic's site but maybe I should note a few of the features that made me fall in love with this camera
- Resolution up to 16
1 MP- 60x optical zoom (it's true)- Accepts SD, SDHC and SDXC (just added a 64GB SDXC and it flies)- Rechargeable battery, AC charger, wrist strap and semi-proprietary USB data cable included- Small and light when compared to a full DSLR- Photo in all the formats you'd expect including 360-degree panoramic and 3D and with various preset settings, too many to mention in a brief review- Supports JPEG (DCF/Exif 2
3), RAW, DPOF for photos, MPO for 3D and AVCHD and MP4 for movies- Photo resolution from 480x480 up to 4608x3456- Video from 640x480 to 1920x1080 at 30 fps- Tripod socket and flash horseshoe (there is a built-in flash, of course)- Relatively easy to navigate menus (must invest some time if you're a first time LUMIX user)- Nice image processing capabilities- Several levels of 'ease of use' from nearly full automatic to allowing you to set everything the way you want it
This bridge camera is not 'cheap' in any way except maybe for the price when factoring in the value it provides but, as a bridge, it may underwhelm those who have used DSLRs for years while 'point and shoot' users may find it too big, too complicated and probably too expensive
I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res
I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way
Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it
I also do notlike the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad
I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution
So far, even with a polarizer, the photos were a little overexposed and it took a while until I found the exposure compensation control so that my pictures could be slightly underexposed, giving me more saturation
The zoom lens was excellent in daylight, even when hand held
I was able to get close-ups and distance shots with one camera
Battery life is ok, more than 250 pictures with a full charge and the camera always on
DMC-FZ70 is definitely a good buy for the price
I am disappointed though that FZ70 doesn't have capability and or plug in for external remote, although the zoom is excellent and you can get close enough to actually see the surface of the moon and or zoom in distant object or birds as they were at your hand reach
It is rather very difficult to remain steady and prevent shaking as the shake of your hand also multiplies 70 times
It is almost impossible to achieve zooming distant object without a tripod that is, if you want clear picture or movie without distortion but this isn't a camera's fault
This camera can't be compared to DSLR's but rather is a good bargain in a bridge camera
There isn't enough right up or videos about this camera but I literally watched every video by Graham Houghton on YouTube about FZ200 and that helped me to decide purchasing FZ70 as the features and functions are nearly identical in these two cameras
I did not expect a zoom camera has such good image
Zoom range is one thing, the stabilization is good too
So far i love and i am an amature
Added 9/24/13 this is by far an amazing camera~~ You need to read the manual which is in PDF form to grasp everything you can do with this
I have also ordered and started using the DMW-LT55 lens with the adapter, you need an adaptor to use the long range lens and I cant even express how great my photos are
This is the camera for someone on a budget but they want bells and whistles
Being as I know you need to use manual setting under the lights and I have yet to learn that the still shots at night were just as great, motion not so much but that's user error not the camera
The action shots when the sun was still up turned out great and I was at the tip top of the bleachers still getting closer shots then my old 24zoom
DSLR's are just not in my budget with the lenses costing so much so I got this
Ive been using an Olympus for the past 3yrs and love it
my old camera can take 40 photos in seconds this one seems to have a lag when continuous shooting
We shall see come Friday night when I use it at my sons football game
So far the indoor shots I took along with some outdoor ones are crisp, clear, and the 60 zoom is about as far as you can go without losing photo quality
I was surprised at the clarity of the long range shots but the true test will come when shooting action sports
I will update the review after a few weeks and my comfort level grows with the camera but for now I am in love
The best value, and the biggest zoom range of them all
Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera
For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package
Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm
If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance
Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience
There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots
This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras
But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range
The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video
It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent
I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release
Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range
I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography
While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't
I'm still discovering its numerous features
Would've if the screen had swivel/tilt, but this was not a surprise to me
I can live with that
Although I was buying a &#34;open box&#34; product I expected that all items would be in the box, however that wasn't the case, the camera was just thrown in the box, battery was loose and there was NO battery charger included
If you don't care about image quality, it's a great camera
My first camera in this line was the FZ 28
It was great
When the FZ 35 came out the following year, I bought it
It was much better than the 28
I was thrilled to get the increased zoom and mega pixels when the FZ 40 arrived, and the image quality continued to be outstanding, although fewer images were keepers which I attributed to the difficulty of controlling hand-shake at the larger zoom factor
I suspect that the problem lies in the difference between CCD and CMOS sensors, although the FZ 47 was a CCD model and it was no better and much worse than the FZ 40
I am sure there are other features, video for example, that are better in the new models
However, if high-resolution, sharp, clear images that capture the beauty of nature in its most realistic rendering is a priority for you, as it is for me, your best bet is to by a used FZ 40, or a FZ 35
I have purchased 4 of the former and 2 of the latter as I am coming to the painful conclusion that Panasonic has abandoned the high-quality image business
As unhappy as I have been returning the cameras, I am very impressed and grateful to Amazon for their incredibly generous and pleasant customer service
I would be reluctant to buy a camera anyplace else
Big Zoom but Poor Image Quality UPDATED
The Sony mentioned below has been incredible, taking great shots and creating wonderful images all in a compact package
I would definitely recommend skipping this Panasonic for something else
Original review:The FZ70 seemed really exciting on paper, but in reality the picture quality was disappointing
Images were frequently washed out and had a soft appearance
About one in ten photos was acceptable, a problem compounded by the fact this was hard to determine until the photos were downloaded and viewed on the computer
As far as the zoom lens, most of the zoom range was unattainable with handheld use
Even in full sun there was significant blur
Zoomed in, the washed out look became even more pronounced
On a bright note, the camera did take good indoor shots with nice color and flash distribution
It's lighter and smaller, the zoom lens covers about as much territory as you can use without a tripod, and the image quality is significantly better
I am amazed with its zoom capability
I appreciate it even more after I download the photos to my computer and as I review them, I notice more details that the human naked eyes couldn't even see when taking the photos
It is obviously not a compact camera to accommodate the powerful zoom lens
Lower the Noise Reduction Setting for Sharper Pics
Also, compared to the FZ200, iZoom performs much better, fewer artifacts, very usable pics
The camera focuses very fast
A great birding camera
I do wish it had an articulating screen, remote shutter socket, larger buffer, but you can't have everything at this price
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70
Bulkier and heavier than expected but it takes very good pictures and people comment on the clarity of it's long reach
Better if optical image stabilization at higher zoom levels was improved
Could also be improved in low light autofocus locking on at higher zoom levels in incandescent lighting
All other functions mostly very good for price range
Overall  nice camera with many excellent features
The zoom is amazing
The quick shutter speed if great for kids sports
This camera was purchased for a disabled person who has tendency to drop things
I have a friend who purchased this and she is a semi professional photographer
This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do
I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account
The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod
This zoom should be illegal
Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot
IQ clarity is a strength for this camera
With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one
after reading the review,  as was said only 2 things missing on this camera, wi-fi & moveable display
otherwise this is one nice camera,  shooting at night from  a moving car thru the glass  really outstanding, settings more than enough, adjustable
Good inexpensive long zoom camera
Really jumps out there for zoom lens with no distortion
A bit large for point in shoot, but likely realistic alternative
I have all kinda of cameras and lenses but when it comes down to it I don't want to carry them around
Battery Drain
The first camera I received drained a fully charged battery after 4 photos and would not take video, it just shut off and said change the batteries
Took about 60 pics and some video with 1 fully charged battery (still have some battery left)
Sounds like they have some lemons out there
I really like the camera, the zoom is great takes great pics
the big Zoom with image stabilization is a dream come true
present
i do know the zoom lens is very good
The pictures were very soft (fuzzy), not good detail at full zoom
Then we purchased an FZ150 and the detail is excellent
We wanted the longer zoom, but were disappointed in the results
An outstanding camera at an excellent price
Awesome zoom
I really love this camera because of the zoom
I would have given it a 5star if not for the size
It's a bit big and not very suited for travelling/For a well balanced camera with good quality and zoom, you may consider the following sony model
Great value, rare 20mm wide angle plus super 60x zoom
I may come back and update more as I have more time with this camera
First, if your expectations are reasonable, I think most will be happy with this camera
At under $300 currently, it delivers great value
It works well for that and also for interior shots
Sharpness is not an issue and color is very accurate, better than average for sure
The zoom seems fine as well
Bit harder to shoot at the long end, of course, but hand held shots can be done, which is amazing at that focal length
Of course, a tripod is great if you can use one along with the timer (since there is no remote release)
Of course there are some issues if you &#34;pixel-peep&#34; at the image 1:1 on your screen, but that's not how the image is going to be viewed
For normal viewing, the images look fine and should print fine
Haze can actually be an issue with the long zoom, but that is true with any zoom in this range
You will need to brace properly or use a tripod for best results, but in a pinch, handheld can be done, the OIS works well
The FZ70 is a bit bigger than I expected, but there's a lot of lens to house, so understandable
It is fairly light and the design is good, a good grip and feels balanced
All the controls are well placed
Panasonic has been making these things forever, so they really have that down pat
The screen seems fine for this price range, the EVF is  good enough for composing images and is a big plus in bright sunlight
Plus I like using the viewfinder for stability when shooting long (bracing the camera against your face helps stabilize it)
Build quality seems good
The FZ70 focuses quickly and well and renders tones smoothly
Tests shots of clouds were better than average in that regard as compared to many compacts and P&S; models
Color is very good
Noise control seems well done at lower ISO's and is usually not noticeable in casual viewing
Certainly fine for this price range and intended uses
There are many modes available, some actually useful, and some interesting in-camera editing capabilities for those who wish to do that
Lots of choices and customization's available
Big thing is, this is a lot of camera for $300 bucks or so, and that 20mm wide end is pretty rare and a nice plus on top of that long zoom
Great so far, awesome zoom, good quality and sharpness; still playing with some of the features
I've gotten some great bird shots and compliments on a close up of the moon
Panasonic website shows Leica lens which is NOT on FZ70
While I have not had a chance to try out the camera very much, my impression is that it feels like cheap plastic, the viewfinder is tiny and grainy and the eyeglass correction lens frequently gets out of adjustment
I'll have to say that this camera has now taken over as my favorite superzoom
I love the overtly quick zoom capabilities it has, never having to struggle with a locked in zoom that sometimes results in missing a very special shot
The quality of my pictures are extremely good, maybe a whisker short of digital SLR type cameras
It took me a bit of time getting acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of the camera after having gotten accustomed to my Sony but since then, wow, am I a happy camper
I just took approximately 550 pictures of a variety of different subjects: owls, sandhill cranes, ducks, blue heron, butterflies and some superior sunset shots and my ability to reframe shots, focus and change angles almost instantaneously allowed me to take numerous shots that I might have missed with another camera having a slower focus capabilities
I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature and has a moderate budget
I can't imagine anyone other than a professional photographer not being highly satisfied with his or her resultsc
This camera is very easy to use
I took the camera on vacation and didn't get a bad picture
The telephoto lens gave me incredible, clear pictures and using the built in editing feature allowed me to make changes before I downloaded the pictures onto my computer when I got home
It was also very easy to switch from still pictures to video
This is my 4th digital camera and it is by far the best I have ever used
It is the first camera I have used that allows me to get non-blurry pictures of my grandchildren who are constantly moving
For the last few years, I've relied on my Pansonic Lumix F27
It's a similar &#34;bridge&#34; camera, fitting between point and shoot and DSLR, but is now several years behind the times
I also recently purchased a Panasonic Lumix TS5A, which is a compact waterproof point and shoot
The 60X zoom is what attracted me to the FZ70
I thought it would help me get great shots of the kids doing their sports, music performances, etc from my seat far up in the stands
But so far I am unable to get really clear shots at the full zoom length
I have no doubt that I could get a good shot with a tripod, but it's usually not possible to bring a tripod and claim the aisle at these kind of events
I am getting some very nice shots at about half the zoom length, though
but I am carrying around the bulk and weight of a 60X zoom, and not being able to use that full range effectively
I am somewhat disappointed in the burst mode of this camera
This camera also had problems with the autofocus when  used on a very cold day (about 10 degrees F)
Perhaps that would happen with any camera though?I will keep using this camera and trying to learn how to maximize its capabilities
It seems wrong that at this point, I prefer my older/lighter Panasonic bridge camera or my new compact waterproof camera to this one
This camera produced better pictures than my friend's Rebel
This FZ70 is bulky & gets weighty over the course of the day, but when going between distance & zoom, and between speed shots & low light shots, it is hard to beat
The only thing I couldn't do was switch to black & white photos, which would have been cool in the fog
As a traveler and someone who frequently goes between regular view and zoom for variations of the same shot, a camera like this Lumix "all-in-one" continues the best camera to suit my needs because I don't have time or patience to switch lenses, and a lens that can handle regular to zoom on an SLR camera is easily a thousand dollars
The FZ-70 packs a lot of features, including panoramic and RAW capabilities
Its functionality in indoor light situations is much better than my previous Lumix cameras
As with my other Lumix cameras, I never use a tripod, and the stability feature of this camera is as good as the previous models
Outdoors, full zoom is marvelous
Performance-wise, the camera's colors consistently look good and the camera consistently produces pictures that look natural
Low light still pictures with no zoom are your best bet for a good shot
Indoor movement (gym situations) with zoom is difficult to achieve
For its price and features, this Lumix DMC-FZ70 is hard to beat
It is certainly worth the money
The features of this camera are outstanding from the fantastic picture quality to the extraordinary 60x zoom lens to the HD video
So easy to use
All round I am extremely pleased with camera: handles well and feels solid and chunky but not too heavy
The zoom is outstanding - optical to x60 excellent and the digital iZoom doubles this with no loss in image size and manageable loss in quality, there is more digital zoom on top of this but then noise really starts to become unacceptable
One other plus point is the start up speed - I would estimate at approx 1 second
Picture quality has been very pleasing from macro to zoom - even on large PC monitor displayDownsides - no real negatives - I'd have liked the LCD not to be fixed but really just a quibble rather then a complaintExtremely pleased I upgraded and delighted with the camera's performance
This one of the greatest camera that I have seen for the money
We on a cruise and this took great picture way our there
The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much
Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs
The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash
Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip
It takes pictures that are worthy of being taken and printed
- Even though its larger and heavier than its predecessors, its still much lighter than an equivalent DSLR
Much better to have separate controls for these 3 MAJOR variants, or at a minimum, a separate button to switch between purposes
- Exposure compensation button has been removed - its now difficult to find and use
- confusing screen display
The simulated analog wheel is confusing to understand, and occupies a far bigger proportion of the display than it should - it blocks out the very subject that one is trying to photograph
- The noise level in dark conditions is just NOT acceptable
I researched hybrid all-in-ones for weeks and finally settled on this model - for the money there is none better
It takes incredible photos, GREAT video and is easy to use
The only negative is the video capture is a proprietary Panasonic file type and you have to buy the conversion software separately to make your DVD's - but, that's not a huge deal considering how well the camera does both photos and video - awesome
Had problems with noise and image quality
This was my fourth Panasonic Lumix camera - I have stepped up from one of the first Bridge cameras that they offered, and I loved them
The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands
The zoom is INCREDIBLE
Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing
Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel)
The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way)
Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted
I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it
The colors are great and the zoom is wonderful
Fantastic camera - great pictures / video
This is a great camera
The zoom on this camera is impressive
I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements
In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible
The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos
I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn
I think this camera's options will satisfy most users
If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures
For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat
So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full
For the money this camera cant be beat
My wife and I take a lot of wild life photos
This camera at its low price is a lot of bang for the buck
I have purchased two of these one for each of us as we like them that well
Balanced
First of all I am not a professional photographer graduated from a university, but know a little more than basic concepts
I truly recommend this camera, but keep in mind you are not buying a $2000 camera
Quality point-and-shoot camera that is easy to use
PROS:- easy to use, right out the box- battery life better  than expected- great value @ $279
00 from Amazon- lens cover  & neck strap are good  quality- on-screen details help when using function dial- transfer  cable & software included- sharp photos with crisp colors- the impressive zoom feature works smoothlyCONS:- Only one
This camera is state of the art  "overall" , in terms of price, versatility & quality
Update on December 10, 2013:  After having used this camera for an extended period of time, I like it even more
And the price is ridiculously low right now, I notice
In my opinion, if you have less than $600 to spend and you want only one bridge camera, then I believe this FZ70 is made for you
But for the rest of us, this FZ70 is an extraordinary camera, even though its long-telephoto lens speed is less than that of the FZ150 or 200
The FZ200, however, costs $150 more than the FZ70, and it has its own weaknesses
, then I think this FZ70 represents the current "state of the art" in affordable bridge cameras
But when we're LOOKING at a beautiful photo taken with (for instance) this camera's wide-angle lens, we're using our central vision to view the photo
I couldn't even tell it was a real estate sign from where I stood, but the photo I took is extremely sharp and clear
Which reminds me, I think some of the negative comments about the FZ70, in terms of sharpness, may just have been due to an erroneous setting on the mode dial
The setting most people will usually use is the iA setting and it is rather inconspicuous in size at least, on the mode dial/wheel
Did I also say that the auto focus on this camera is FAST and accurate?  Well, it's "VERY fast, and accurate"
Update: September 25, 2013:  I am even more impressed now with this camera and its IQ (image quality) and its features
But it is NOT the camera's fault, and the more I use this camera and the more I read the CD manual, the more I love it
Again, this is not simply a "point and shoot" camera, although much of the time you get excellent results just using the iA Mode (and altering nothing else)
But you can get fantastic, and often sharper photos if you experiment with one or more of the details you can change on this camera, and the way you set up the focus for a photo is one of the most important variables
Great Price for Quality Camera
Bought this for my wife and the 60X zoom is fantastic
We will be traveling from AZ to AK and we'll see how the animal pics turn out
She had a pervious version of this camera and loved it
It's a little bulky, but mainly because of the 1200mm zoom capability
Awesome
This camera is everything I was looking for
Light weight great zoom no changing lenses
Only thing is can't figure out how to take a pic without the red flash even if I turn off red eye function
Otherwise LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT
Better than I thought
I recently bought this to replace a Lumix G3
Although the G3 had very, very good image quality and even great video (in good light), a m4/3 or DSLR is an investment item
You need to invest in lenses which can be very costly, add to that having to carry around extra gear and swapping lenses on the fly
That being said, let's look at the FZ70
I did some sample shots inside the house in a dimly light room
Images up to ISO1600 were pretty good for a 1/2
3 sensor
The wide 20mm lens helps, as does the f2
8 in low light
The aperture quickly drops as you zoom in on objects
I  shot some video in the same dim light and objects near the light source are great
Speckeled noise is much more visible in lower light areas
AUTO video does a pretty decent job - there is a slight auto-focus noise as the camera focuses during video
I look forward to using the camera outside in brighter light
My guess is the camera will perform wonderfully for both stills and video
The FZ70 60x zoom is a bit much, anything beyond 25x probably needs a tripod
IT would be nice if you could set a zoom limit
I will update this as I use the camera more
For sub $300, I think it's a great value
Knowledge of a camera's PASM settings will help a great deal here as you can really break through the surface features if this camera and get a lot out of it
UPDATE:One Month Later:  This camera needs a lot of light to perform at its best
In bright light, the camera excels
Images are a tad soft, but Auto+ does a great job producing solid images
I've never seem a camera shoot so well in Auto
I like AUTO+ because you still have control over some items like exposure
I read that it is recommended to drop exposure by 1/3
I've tried this and the results are great
No blow outs of over-exposing
I want to "love" this camera, but right now I just "like" it
I am hoping to experiment more and get some very good results from this camera, INDOOR and outdoor
Strange noise from the lens
The camera is fantastic
Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding
When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended
When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light
So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange
The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom
I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens
You can find those images at the Users Gallery above
Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable
I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile
I am testing more features every day and will update this post with what I find
very good
excellent camera, the zoom is amazing, plus its effects on photographs very useful, I am delighted with my camera, I recommend
This camera is amazing
The camera takes the best zoom pictures
I took the camera into Best Buy to find a camera bag for it
The salesman kept playing with it
He loved it
The price was very good
I priced it at other stores, and Amazon beat them by $100
Now I need to learn how to use some of the special features on it
Good grab and go camera
While this camera has 16MP like my other micro43 cameras (OM-D EM5, GX7, so forth), they are not in the same class, so don't compare this camera to any mirrorless interchangeable or DSLR
Others have mentioned and tested the camera hardware and image quality ad infinitum, so I only want to point out several items that haven't been mentioned in other reviews:1
The tripod mount is not aligned with the axis of the lens--it is offsetted to the right side of the camera by about 2
5cm (1 in)
This matters quite a bit for panoramas
Since there is no in-camera panorama or panorama guide, the axial shift means a need to be conscientious about the framing and focal length choices
Making sure there is sufficient inter-shot overlaps and the perspective distortion of the overlapping areas
May also need a little bit more post production work during the stitching process
Image stabilization is not even close to the same level as a DSLR or even the Olympus OM series
The EVF-LCD switch is manual because there is no eye sensor
If you are used to automatic switching, it should not be a big deal to go to manual because the switch is within easy reach of the thumb
The eyepiece for the EVF is hard plastic so eyeglass wearers would find that uncomfortable and doesn't block stray lights
A step down ring 55-52 will not work at the widest angles (~20mm-24mm)
It will cause a ring/vignette
Inexpensive camera has amazing zoom feature
Love this camera
It is light, 16 mp and the zoom is fantastic
There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all
I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip
I should get some amazing nature pictures
Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x)
Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension
I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50
This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon
I am very happy with my purchase
I am very pleased with this camera
The camera exceeded my expectations
I do nature photography
With that much zoom I can take photos of birds farther away than I could before
The images are sharp
The three negative criticisms I have are that it saves RAW images as RW2
I prefer adjusting the zoom by hand instead of the power driven zoom
And there is no lens hood
But I am still very pleased with the camera and give it a top rating
Excellent for the price
As expected, cheaper than the competition and as good as the competition
Very good when you travel and easy to use
Also, there are no instructions as to how to format a SD card
The image stabilization system is EXCELLENT
Great Superzoom
I've been looking for a great superzoom camera for several years, tried the Canon SX50 which is very good as well but settled on the Lumix
It takes great shots, photo printouts are excellent quality for my wife who is an artist
Took a shot of a full moon, blew it up a little on my software program and the craters on the moon showed up fantastically
It takes a little getting used to but highly recommend it
Great camera
Best digital camera I've owned so far
Any person not getting what they want from this camera, is expecting WAY too much
I've gotten some of the best pictures of my family from this camera
Great product
This is a great camera
The 60x times optical zoom is like having aportable telescope
Every person who has seen it work is amazed
One single lens covers 20mm-1200mm equivalent and  Full 1080/60iHD Panasonic Video recording with auto focus
All of this in one camera
No more lenses to change
No chance of dust and stuff getting in the camera,especially on windy days
DMC-FZ70 camera
It is a nice product in it's category, wide angle to super tele in one lens
I compared it to mirror less Samsung NX2000with 20-50mm and 50-200mm lenses, and DSLR camera 18-200mm, looking for reasonable quality photos
The camera is big, almost the size of DSLR
Too big for alternate camera
Pictures in a sunny day the images were nice, but a bit soft
In a room (without flash) the camera enhanced the color and brightness, to look like a picture that processed using Photoshop, In dark room it was much worst
The Samsung NX2000 that has bigger sensor, was much more accurate, and the pictures, were much better, no blurry photos
The touch screen/screen resolution made it nice experience
The real deal is when you look at the pictures, when you send them to print
it was obvious that the Panasonic was not good enough, the Samsung NX2000 was on the edge, and both could not be compared to the DSLR
The NX2000 and the DSLR were almost equal in outdoor sunny day photograpy, but the Panasonic quality was not there
Inside the house the differences could be seen especially in lower light
I graded the Panasonic with  3 stars, as it is reasonably priced for whatever you get
For $200 (or less) more The NX 2000 with 2 lenses is a better deal
The problem is that when you take a photo, and you want to get the best results, and the image is not good, sometimes you can not duplicate that moment
I don't get really good pictures with it
I tried the IA and IA+ with this camera and took many pictures in different conditions
Most of them came out to be unsatisfactory
The outdoor ones were better than the indoor ones
I also changed the picture resolutions to try, but I was still not happy with the results
Incredible zoom which allowed me to capture poster-worthy images of the craters on this recent Supermoon, even w/o the benefit of a tripod
Curious to see now if it will pull into focus these Drones in the NW skyline -
I was very happy with this purchase
The camera works as expected and the video and photos taken are really great
I read reviews and it met all my expectations
Friends and family have been amazed at the quality of the photos taken with this camera
I really have been really happy with the wind noise reduction when taking videos and the ability to stay in focus when zooming in video mode
Disappointment
First, I must state that I have NOT purchased this camera
My "disappointment" is due to the fact that this model DOES NOT HAVE A LEICA LENS
This was the great selling point of their cameras
I have four (4) of them, all "basic" point and shoot
I have been an amateur photographer for 35 or so years
have seen and used various brands/styles, film (slides and prints, different kinds of films) and digital
Also have Pentax, Nikon, Kodak cameras (SLRs and P&S;)
Panasonic stands out as an superb camera
So much so, I generally use my point and shoot far more than my SLR (unless taking pictures of birds)
Having a Leica lens makes it the Cadillac of point and shoots
I primary do landscape/birds
Many of my birding friends who have them
when doing work where the object isn't so "flighty" (
)or far away
without a Leica lens, I'm sorry
It's just another camera
He verified the FZ60 has the Leica lens, but it "appeared" the FZ70 did not
Gee, thanks for wasting my time
Bottom line, whatever camera, in my book it isn't the camera itself
it's the lens
I have to decide whether I'm going with the FZ60 or a Cannon
Love love loveeeeee
This is SO easy to use
I was nervous when I received it because my camera experience has been a smartphone
The instructions are easy
I am ever so pleased with this purchase and the photo quality is AMAZING
Happy, happy, happy with my Lumix FZ70
Went to Grapefruit League spring training games - bright Florida sunlight
Took great photos using max zoom from right field with no tripod
Also some great bird shots using mid tele in overcast situation - still great photos
Easy to use, great features - I recommend this camera for telephoto work without extra lenses
Great for vacationers
Excellant Camera
This is an amazing piece of technology for the price
It can take brilliant photo and video, well beyond my expectations
Great battery life and easy to use controls
I was considering getting the Nikon 520 due to it's slightly higher resolution but got this instead because of the much longer focal length zoom
I am impressed, and very glad I got this camera
The 60x zoom is fantastic for wildlife, and the image stabilization system works very well
I have taken handheld shots of the moon with decent results
The very wide angle end of the focal range is great for indoor social shots
The 'intelligent Auto' setting is just amazing and the autofocus is very customizable and very fast
Easy to use and 60x zoom is awesome
I even dropped it down a 10 foot cliff with me behind it and it worked fine after the fall
However I do not recommend this
The 60x zoom hand held pictures are amazing
Easy to operate
The viewing screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight
A tilt screenwould help,but this is a common problem
Viewfinder works well asalternative
Overall gives good value for pric range
Loved this camera
Recommend It
A very nice camera
Very versatile  with the super zoom
Also very impressed with some of the special easy to use special effects like the background blur as well as others
Wish it had the adjustable viewer screen but I knew that before I purchased it
Fits well in the hand
Simple fast control buttons for the most used functions
Zoom and Burst Shooting a Big Disappointment
This camera was supposed to replace my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 10 mp with an 18X optical zoom which has been a great camera
However, the two features that caused me to buy this camera are a huge disappointment
The 60X optical zoom produces fuzzy unusable pictures at the high end of the zoom
I have no idea why Panasonic would advertise such a high powered zoom that performs so poorly
Also, the burst shooting is a joke
Instead of the 9 FPS as advertised, I could only get 3, then wait, refocus, then 3 more
I could be at fault on not understanding how to use the burst feature, but not with the poor quality of the zoom
I will say that if you don't care about the high powered zoom and burst shooting, this may be a good camera for you, but if those features are important keep looking
Not As good as my FZ200
I have an FZ200 and am very pleased with it so far
I thought I would like the extra zoom on the FZ70
The photos are to soft and Just out of focus on the ones I tried
I wanted to like this camera ,but it does not come close to the FZ200 in photo quality
I have tried the same settings that I use on my other cameras and was not pleased with the results at all
Another fault was when I tried to work with RAW on my MAC
I found out it will not work with iPhoto or Aperture as of this date,maybe in the future
I can enlarge photos from my FZ200 and get a lot better results for the wildlife photos i take than this camera
So back it goes
I am not sure ,but think some of the difference is lens quality between the two cameras
The FZ200 has a Leica lens
works great
I love this camara, it is amazing what you can do with it and its zoom is awsome
The only down side I think it feals a little fragile
The lens was not as good as I expected
The pictures were soft and the lens was slow to focus
need the speed
I need someone's help with this camera when I do shots at a basketball game I'm not sure of all the settings yet, can someone help I took a lot of pictures (outdoors ) but need help inside
The outdoor shots are great
I own a Canon SLR, two Fuji bridge cameras, two Olympus point and shoot and one other Panasonic pocket point and shoot
By far, this is the best camera I have
Love the zoom (WOW
)  Really great stabilization
I am shooting the neighbors flowers one petal at a time
Really love this camera
An awesome camera for the price
Understand the majority of reviews are done by well meaning rookie photographers
Many bought the camera without downloading the operator's manual or checking out professional reviews first
As you read the ones here it is easy to see the rookies, whining about everything
]  Also helps to learn more on how to take pictures so you will not blame the camera for your failures
At amazon
com, search for "Kodak photography books" or any book you think you may need
See if your local library has them, or download an ecopy
Take the time to research the perfect digital camera for you, learn more on photography, and have a very enjoyable time capturing your memories
Aloha
Great Camera
I had been searching for a new camera for some time
This camera does almost everything I want in a new camera
Since it came from Amazon, every aspect of the purchase came off without a hitch
canon SX50 vs FZ70
Can anyone give your opinion in the difference of cameras and photo quality of both the SX50 and FZ70,, at the 20mm and 1200mm
Would you give up your Canon SX50 for the FZ70?
I am not a professional, but this camera makes me look like one
I bought this for work because I need to occasionally take pictures or video of things to upload to social media sites
I am not a good photographer
I just need something that works
But I truly was blown away by this camera
I only use the basic, camera-figures-out-everything setting
I know nothing about any of the other settings
But now my pics have gone from sufficient to nearly artistic
The quality and ease are simply amazing
I kid you not, I was able to get framable, clear, up close shots of a bald eagle that was sitting in a tree about a quarter mile away
And I was not using a tripod or anything else
Just point, zoom and shoot
So listen to all these other reviewers who actually know something about cameras, but as a complete idiot when it comes to this stuff, this camera is great
Son's Christmas Gift
My son absolutely loves his camera
It has many extras on it that I almost wished that I would have ordered one for my other son as well
Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16
1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical image
I purchased this Panasonic LUMIX Digital Camera for my husband, as a Christmas gift
Not only for the specifications that I wanted, but also, for the affordable price, that included accessories, this Digital camera
has met our expectations
We live in South Texas, and have not yet, explored all of what Nature has to offer
First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery
Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference
It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes
They do not automatically credit your account
Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered
Now as to the camera itself
So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful
It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it
One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it
So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back
Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said "oh my golly there is a continuous noise"
So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine
I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan
That is not a deal killer for me
The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7
Fits a man's hand better
The software that comes with it is impressive
I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos
Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC
Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic
I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash
Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that
At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly
Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review
UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for
The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting
Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes
Very impressive
More capability here than I would expect for this price
I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with
Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers
I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs
For this price point you can't beat this camera
Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked
Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder
So I will just be carrying one camera now
One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens
Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body
always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix
Saves carring a lot of gear
I bought this camera to use when I need a wide to tele travel camera
It works great and I don't have to carry extra len's and equipment like I do when i use my Canon 70D
With all the features The Pansonic has I can shoot in any condition
point and shoot camera
takes great pics close up and far away
quality great an every light weight
lens is attached so no head for changes lens
this is great for trips afar
WONDERFULL
JUST CAME BACK FROM TRIP
THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING
MUCH TO LEARN BUT THE AUTOMATIC SETTING CAN DO MOST OF WHAT IS NEEDED
PICTURES AND VIDEO AT THE SAME TIME
VERY FAST FOCUSING AAND FAST ZOOM
PICTURE STABILIZED VERY WELL
FZ70 Review
I always purchase a Panasonic Lumix camera because I really like the ones I have purchased in the past but the FZ70 has a few changes from my FZ50 that I can't say I care for
The main complaint is the fact that every time I want to remove the memory card or replace the battery with a fresh one, I have to totally remove it from my tripod
I miss the "flipping the screen" option that is on the FZ50
I also would rather have a "slide on/off" button like on the FZ50 than the type that is on the FZ70
Something I have discovered that I do like
I have now been able to take videos of the sunset with out that "white light" line or I think it is called light sheer
Always before when the "white light" started to appear I would have to stop recording because the white line appeared in the video
now I can continue to record because it NEVER shows up
On the other hand, when trying to take a still of the sunset
the shot looks perfect before you press the button but when it displays the photo taken, the light is so bright that the shot isn't any good and the photo does the same even when I decrease the exposure to the max
What I gained in one area I lost in another between my fz50 and  fz70
I am not a professional photographer and am still trying to figure out some of the features on the camera
I am a hands on person and learn better by experimenting with the camera than reading the instruction manual
I guess I will have to post more as I learn and experiment with the camera
Couldn't be happier
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 right out of the box an amazing point and shoot camera and becomes an even more awesome camera when you really start digging into it
The user interface is simple, fast, and easy to navigate
Anyone who has used a digital camera made in the last three years wont have any issues with it at all
), I had to limp by for a few days recording everything to the internal memory, which surprisingly was doing quite well keeping up with my ultra happy shutter finger
Of the dozen or so other digital cameras I've used over the years, this Lumix was able to access, load, and save the pictures to the internal memory faster than any other
huge plus
Once I picked up my SD card, I really went crazy snapping shots
The obvious reason for getting the DMC-FZ70 is for it's amazing 60x optical zoom
It totally delivers
Up close, midway, or far out, it handles it all and with amazing clarity
Astonishingly even at 60x the pictures come out clear WITHOUT a bi or tripod
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 provides an awesome midpoint between an SLR and your typical point and shoot that was greatly being overlooked
Couldn't be happier
Great Camera
I bought this camera for shooting video, the lens and quality are great, the price was perfect for what I needed
I only shoot with Panasonic, video or photo and have never had a problem
and that's been for at least 25 years
Great Camera
I have been a fan of the Panasonic Lumix Cameras for years
This is my third one, and it's a beauty
Also it uses the same memory cards and battery that the DMC-FZ40 did
The 60X zoom is amazing
Perfect for carrying into the field
For years, I've debated what camera to take birding
The choice is between being a BIRDER, that is, using binoculars to look at birds, and being a BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER, more interested in the great photo than spotting everything
Fortunately, I have had the good luck to travel with photographers, leaving me free to spend time looking
I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant
Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me
It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos
The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away
If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot
However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper
I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on
The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip
good
Its a good camera, have an excelent resolution and extraordinary zoom, i hope dont have inconvenients and continue using by a good time this camera
I Expected a Lot
I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future
Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs
UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots
I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks
This camera simply works for me
I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7
The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects
Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range
I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed
I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots
I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective
But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you
Does not meet the hype, Aviod it completely
I know this is long-winded, but please bear with me
April 30, 2014Although I have a fair amount of experience with 35mm SLR photography, this is my first "non-pocket" digital camera
After reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other places on the web, as well as watching too many You Tube videos, I came to the conclusion that the FZ70 would be a good, affordable  replacement for my aging 35mm Cannon SLR
It is lightweight and compact given that huge piece of glass on the front
It comes with everything you need to start except a case and SD card
But the best I can give this camera is 3 stars
(Now 1 star- see update)First, there is no remote shutter release system available for this camera
While there are enough automatic modes and settings to keep you busy learning until the unit is obsolete and it has to be replaced, the manual mode settings are limited
Tech support is rather lackluster
It took them 45 minutes to answer one question, including the time it took them to give me the answer to a question someone else asked
It takes "OK" photos- good but the color and focus never seems quite correct, especially when taking pictures that require a long depth of field
I also can't notice much effect using their stabilization system
I can most closely compare them to a $150 dollar pocket camera
I can't return it because I am leaving for the Grand Canyon next week and will not have time
While disappointed, I guess I have no one to blame but myself
I just don't know how much more research I could have done
June 14, 2014I took this camera on a month long vacation and took about 250 photos using all the program settings
I found the photos to be about equal to those of my 10yr old $50 Cannon pocket camera
A lot of hype is made because this FZ70 takes photos using the RAW format, which Panasonic says is superior to the JPEG format
What they don't tell you is that the camera uses some type of proprietary RAW2 format
Stay clear of the DMC FZ70 Panasonic camera and buy the Cannon
Really good for what it is
I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price
While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well
The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application
High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders
Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light
The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper
Side dug out my window mount because you must have a steady mount if you're going to take pictures at high magnification
Now in the book it says something about pushing the button halfway down and the focus button
I haven't got the hang of that yet, so I will have to read the book
But just using the camera like I did with my old Panasonic, pushing the capture button down halfway until I see the green image box, I got some pretty good pictures
I also got some out of focus pictures because I was fiddling around trying to use that focus button
Like I say, I got to go back to the manual
I learned that I can use the 60 X manual focus but that I'm not restricted to that
That food in the camera and after four shots, it said the card was full
Well it only had four shots on
I have put back in the camera level tested again but it looks like I will be buying a new card
I'll let you know how things go for me
Wow, what a zoom
I added on another zoom lens that attaches right to the front of the existing lense, with no adapters or anything needed, and now I have over 100X zoom on a compact digital camera
Now, I am not a professional photographer by any means, and can't tell you any technical stuff, but this camera is AWESOME
I had two Nikon DSLR's in the past, and they were just very complicated and very heavy for me to use all the time, this is fairly lightweight, and takes stunning photos
I'm in love
Between this and my LX7 I am set for awhile with cameras
Excellent
I am very pleased with this purchase
It is an excellent device
It has worked very well
I recommend this camera to others people
the best in semiprofesional cameras
the pictures are asome, the zoom is the best, and have take some full moon pictures that you can see tha craters
the best camera i have bought
if you are insterest in good pictures and don't have the skills to be a profesional taking pictures this s the camera you need
I love it
Nice Camera, full HD pics and Video, not as heavy as las lumix versions
I am really happy to have it
this camera is amaizing , very easy to use and the 60x zoom is wonderfull i need more time for review the many options to use
Excellent camera
Excellent camera for the price point
Even at max zoom, the auto focus can compensate for my hands, the pictures are very clear and crisp, and it does pretty decent video too
So far so good
First I have to say I am not a professional photographer, but an amateur that usually likes to shoot landscapes
Although I've had this camera since November, I had not been able to use it
I was let in at the AMA and People's Choice Awards but was told not to use it
(I did not want to be the person kicked out of an awards show)
I finally used it for the first time at Maroon 5's NYE show in Vegas
It was my first time to shoot manual at a concert
I was about 300 feet away from the stage, I just set the widest aperture it would let me at whatever zoom I had it, which was I think 4, ISO was between 400-800
I was very pleased with the images I got
On the head-shoulder shots, you could see Adam Levine's frown lines and crows feet, no noise, it was awesome
My frustration was in uploading the images
Any input on this issue is greatly appreciated
Until I get the update to solve this, I will be shooting RAW and JPEG
Overall, it's a good camera and takes good quality pictures
The main downfall I have and the reason for an average rating is because the booklet show a port for a remote but the camera does not have one
This is one model that does not allow for a remote shutter release
I contacted Panasonic and was not happy with the response
I doesn't look like the plan to make a remote shutter release for this model
Very disaapointed
great camera for the price
All about the zoom, baby
The zoom really is incredible in this camera
I need to experiment with it more, but so far very pleased
Best Camera I've ever owned
I'm totally impressed with this Lumix
I'm not an uber-photographer but I know my way around point/shoot cameras
I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera
I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji
All are well made and do what you would expect
But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good
I have not even tried all the features yet
Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting
Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer
Just a quick example: Last week during the full &#34;blood moon&#34; we had a great view of it here in California
I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited
When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button
Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots
I could hear it during the process
The aggregated image was spectacular
The blood moon effect was awesome
I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot
Did I mention the lens? Killer resolution on both wide and telephoto modes
Very happy with this camera
Although this camera is bigger than I wanted, I already have a Canon, I love the quality of the photos, color, sharpness
It is easy to use and I would recommend it if you dont mind the size
Majority of pictures were blurry no matter what I tried
I had a Canon TSi for 5 years and recently my large zoom lens stopped working
Besides the normal family pictures I take lots of pictures of my kids playing basketball, football and soccer
I tried the camera for basketball and soccer and maybe got 5% useable pictures, the rest were blurry
I kept going back and reading directions and trying different settings
And yes I used a tripod as well (which did help and got the rate up to 15%)
But even half of my &#34;portrait&#34; pictures were out of focus and blurry
I'm going to return this and check out the amazon reviews to try a different camera, any recommendations for good cameras for taking sport shots??
I love the zoom
Taking pictures of objects at a distance is no problem for this camera
I already own a digital SLR camera and a 300mm zoom lens, but this approximates 600mm optical (1200mm digital) zoom, which is amazing
Holding the camera still at maximum zoom is always an issue - you need a tripod to get a clear picture, but when the conditions are right you can get that perfect shot with this camera
(And it is so much lighter than my digital SLR
Great Shots for less Money
I miss my Nikon horribly but I do enjoy this little gem for about half the price
The pictures were very comparable to my Nikon Coolpix 500
I also like the fact I can attach an awesome zoom lens for very close and personal pictures
I can also attach a wide angle lens for panoramic shots
The only thing that truly disappoints me is that it does not automatically shut its self off
User beware and remember to bring several extra batteries for long photo shoots
Mediocre Image Quality
I was impressed with the functionality of the camera
Focus was fast, shot to shot recycle time was impressive, battery life was astounding (well over 400 pictures and the battery just dropped by one indicator on the 3-light battery bar)
The two speed zoom was nice, easy to control and fairly quiet
I liked that the mode dial appeared on the LCD when you changed settings
I shot over 850 images meticulously testing settings and options in numerous situations and ended up with three pictures I thought were really good
grainy, cluttered, blurry
Post dawn, full light shots of surfers looked like Pointilization art
Even when only zooming out 20x - 30x, far from the extreme limit of the camera, I didn't get one picture I bothered to keep out of well over 150 tries
I also went to a horse show
Full daylight, light fluffy clouds and again shooting well below the full 60x (1,200mm) zoom of the camera and the results were horrid, grainy, full of noise
Many shots looked like badly done art filters in Photoshop rather than photographs from a moderately expensive bridge camera
I also shot a few images at the horse show under the shade of trees and even in iA mode letting the camera pick all the settings and not zooming in at all, images were dark, mottled and grainy
The functionality was great but that's not the most important aspect of a camera, photo quality is and I just wasn't happy enough with the results and returned the camera
For a new $350 camera I expected better
I believe mine may have been one of the rare defective items that occasionally escape quality control
nice quality
ok a Christmas present for my wife (wink) and its awesome so far
took it to Christmas brunch and now on our way to dinner
the compliments are great but the usability and pictures are better
60x optical zoom
WOW
I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now and have shot about 1500 photos with it
I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me
At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom
The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack
I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before
I am more than happy with this camera
Pros:- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?- Small enough to keep with me
Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home
- Picture quality is decent
Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either
Cons:- Battery life
Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going
- File name conflicts
Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos
There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX
JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used
There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem
JPG
An extra step I wish I didn't have to remember to do
Excellent Camera for the Price
This is not my primary digital camera
I also own a Nikon D300
You cannot compare a high-end semi-pro camera with a point and shoot camera with a fixed zoom lens
This Panasonic camera takes excellent pictures
It is light-weight (Compared to my D300) and has a wealth of built-in controls to handle a variety of picture taking situations
It takes a 55mm filter size
The eyepiece view finder is just ok but I prefer to shoot with this rather than the 3&#34; LCD viewer
Note that the 3&#34; LCD view screen is not bad at all
Also some of the batteries listed are not for the FZ-70
However this review is about the camera and it is a good camera for a beginner or a travel camera
Excellent camera
I purchased this camera after seeing one in use on a trip to Costa Rica where it was excellent in capturing birds and monkeys in the forest canopy
Several features contributed to this
It has a wide zoom range allowing it to capture both wide views and incredible closeups of distant objects - birds and monkeys in this case
Additionally it has an effective anti-shake capability, making tripods for long shots not always necessary
Love this camera
Nothing I don't like about it, range is the best
great resolution, battery life is fantastic, love that you can turn the camera on before removing the lens cap without grinding the motor like on the Nikon P 500
UGH
Anyway, it's really nice quality and very durable
Am having a ball with it
Excellent Bridge Camera for Amateurs and "Semi-Pros"
My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom
We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible
After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70
I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made
First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality
Not chintzy at all
I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person
Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing
We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality
If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort
Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc
Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part
At this price point, you can't go wrong
Highly recommended
Good, but not as great as competitors
Owned for a few weeks now
Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds
The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification
The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still
It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect
That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear
The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom
Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon
This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings
The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge
At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision
It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class
Excellent Camera
Just ordered, and received it in 1 day
The camera is everything if not more than I expected, the quality is tops
Photos are superb
Love the 3D settings, the panorama settings, everything
This one is tops in my books
really like this camera
for the FZ-70 that was 1200 plus the digital zoom
the others were not good competitors at quick focus and holding the focus while hand held at the max zoom
Used the Camera for holiday photos and all were great, and almost never used the flash because it wasn't necessary
Speaking of the flash,  there is also undocumented, that the flash is indeed a pop-up, however it is a manual pop-up
meaning when it needs the flash it has a message in the view finder or the LCD screen to open the flash
the Flash doesn't pop-up automatically when needed like other cameras
The first time this happened, i was very tempted to take it back
however i realized that when in a situation where i knew a flash may be needed, i could just open it up
I have experimented with some of the special features while reading the manual
let me say first off that it works great in full auto mode  iA mode
however the special features are wondrous
one i really like is the &#34;single color&#34; mode where you can take a photo of a person wearing a ball cap, and make the ball cap the only thing in color with the rest of the photo in BW
The manual is huge, since there are so many capabilities of this camera
I downloaded to may tablet and read a feature and try it on the camera
this is going to be a long process
Bottom line - i think the professional reviewers were paid by another company to push their camera, and am very glad i tested all of the contenders before purchasing
One recommendation no matter which camera you buy,  get the fastest SDHC/XC card you can find
review by Larry Ponziani
This is the best camera have ever had
it uses a MOS sensor which is much more accurate and clear than CMOS that is used everywhere
the 60x lens with image stabilization is amazing
you will hear the little stabilization motors running when it is zoomed out
it has great wide angle at the other end
the battery lasts way longer than any point and shoot
it has dozens of modes to shoot under
I bought a 64gig chip for it
Don't hesitate to get this camera
larry ponziani
Like it better than the comparable Cool Pix
My sister is not an accomplished photographer at all, but she found this camera at a local camera store and took it on our trip to Tanzania in February
I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface
Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix
And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones
When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit
I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase
FREAKING AWESOME ZOOM
I feel so  PROFESSIONAL when that whopping zoom goes out
Great pix
I'm still learning settings
It's  my  4th Lumix
Great Camera
This is a great choice for $277, it's got a great zoom lens and takes clear photos
I do wish it had the wifi capabilities like some newer models but this is a great option for beginners like me
Solid camera
Love the zoom
Feels good
Lots of fun
Primarily I leave it on intelligent auto focus, and have no worries
Good point and shoot
Middle price and use bridge type camera
great &#34;bridge&#34; type camera
lots of great features even for a beginner
software for editing a little &#34;lax&#34;, but over-all very good for home use
will be taking to sons college graduation
Practice with settings and feel before you &#34;need&#34; it
Have not printed yet but am encouraged
very glad of purchase after much review about features and price
HAPPY
Excited to use this as my side arm
I bought this as a carry around
I shoot with D3s and D600 Nikons
Everything seems great so far
I had an older FZ model years ago that I loved and am excited about this one
I have not yet figured out how to set aperture in manual mode so if anyone knows please comment
may be later I can have a better oppinion on it
Love this camera
Took this camera with me on a safari trip to Africa and I was thrilled with my pictures
I did not want to deal with multiple lenses but wanted a step up from my Cannon with a 20X optical zoom
Got great shots with the with the telephoto and the shutter speed was fast enough to catch great animal shots
I love this camera
Great camera
This cam is a very good electronic device
The incredible zoom and the quality of the pictures makes satisfied of this choice
Really need an owners manual
I love the camera, but it is much different that my other Lumix FZ cameras, and I really really needed an owners manual to take to Yellowstone with me the day after I got it
I was not expecting too much considering the extreme zoom and the price, but it takes very good shots even on iA
Being sure the image stabilizer is on if very difficult to ascertain
In fact I am still trying to figure out how to change the f
stop on it for more depth of field
One of the best buys around all things considered, especially for those who shoot wildlife
Great camera with super zoom ability
This is a great camera for users who want to use long focal length for wildlife and don't want to spend money for a huge, heavy and expensive DSLR lens
Build Quality:Overall, the product quality is very good for this price range
I don't own a lot of compact cameras
I have experienced with several DSLRs from Canon, Nikon and Pentax
This camera has similar or even better quality than the entry level DSLR, but definitely less solid than mid-range or full frame ones (Nikon D90, Canon 7D, 5D Mark
The body is all plastic expect for the hot shoe
The hot shoe design is not perfect
My Yongnuo-560II cannot fit in because of the big built-in flash housing next to the hot shoe
The pop-up flash can trigger the off-camera flash without problem
I think this is a good thing for people who is learning photography
Lens quality:I am satisfied with the image quality
DO NOT expect some DSLR or mirrorless cameras' image quality
This camera can do a lot of things that others cannot with such a low cost
The image is perfectly fine for travel and family
The zoom and focus are relatively quick and quiet
I will upload some images when I shoot more with it
It is not very interesting to zoom 100% or check pixels for this camera (or any other camera)
Again, this is perfect for travel or family use
Others:1200mm is possible with hand-held, but you need good light and at least 1/200 shutter speed
The manual could be better
It is too simple for such a camera
It took me some time to learn how to use it, because a lot of buttons have many functions
Nice camera
Great camera
Nice photo quality
Good Camera - Still Learning Features
I'm new to this camera and new to super zoom cameras, but likewhat I've seen so far
I'll post a picture of a football gamein normal view then in 60x view when I figure out how to addcustomer photos
Great camera for the photographically challenged, stabilization is superb
Even I can take decent pictures with this camera
I have a hand tremor so normally have a great deal of difficulty getting decent pictures
Went to Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square PA and followed my normal practice of taking an enormous number of pictures in the hope of getting a few decent shots
Out of 337 332 were good
(I posted some shots I took that day
) Even with the zoom extended completely I am able to get decent pictures
The AI setting does a great job even in low light conditions, it's easy to use, and battery life is excellent
I am beyond pleased and will experiment with settings other than AI
I have not used the video feature so can't comment on that
What a GREAT camera for 98% of all my camera needs
Yo-This replaces my 'old' Lumix DMC-FZ60 and gives me a greatly improved wider and way longer lens distance with somewhat better picture quality
This is not a small camera - has look and feel of a good SLR at a much more reasonable price point
I have and will continue to recommend this fine camera to all interested folks
Wife loves it
First camera she is reading the manual to see what else it can do
Love the details of birds  at 60x
This camera exceeded my expectations
the zoom for this camera is great with a high focus and you can take photos in any light conditions and the photos will still be sharp and clear , i have bought this camera to take with me on a vacation and i have made the correct choice when buying this camera
Just about anyone should love this
AMAZING zoom
If for no other reason, this camera gets 5 stars for the zoom
60x optical zoom is impressive and very sharp, but what is even most impressive is the digital zoom
It is amazingly stable and sharp with little noise in side, and simply fantastic outside
You have many shooting options which is great
I have never been a fan of point and shoots for my serious photography, always relying on one of Canons
Well, I think that for the most part, I may not be using them much anymore (except for macro work)
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is amazingly versatile and can pretty much take care of all of your photography needs
Take a picture of a full moon with full zoom
It is amazing
I had to go into my settings because digital zoom was disabled on my camera
Once you do, you will never turn it off
I really cannot explain my level of awe from this camera
I doubt you will find its equal without spending at least twice as much
It is bulky, but it is a camera, and certainly not as bad as a DSLR plus lenses, etc
The flash works very well and is strong enough that I really cannot complain
The only real problem I had was filling up my 32 gig card too quickly
I started having fun again
Fun that I have not had with photography in a long time
I bought what I needed to be able to take pictures when I had to, but now I have a camera to take pictures because I want to
For me, that is a huge bonus
The camera is stylish and comfortable to use
Burst mode is fast but inside I did get a little blur between images, and it was not because of very fast action, but more when someone was moving their arm/hand
I have several different cards, but I really recommend something fast, like an extreme or extreme pro by san disk
They are so fast, and virtually no waiting
The camera starts up quickly and has almost no lag at all
I think most people would not notice it
I also love that I do not have to use the screen and often use the viewfinder
Video quality and sound is also very good
the camera is fairly intuitive and can be used without reading anything, but I HIGHLY suggest you read up on it and get the most out of this camera
If you are looking for a good general camera with great optics, look no further
You get down to 20mm, btw, which is wide enough to capture a large family reunion photo, and in the next shot you can fill the frame with one persons eye
The finish of the camera has a nice tactile feel to it, and the next strap, while not high end, is comfortable enough
I love that I no longer have to lug around my camera (suit)case
:)I recently recorded my sons bastkeball game and the video was great
I do notice that when I shoot in flourescent lighting, there sometimes is a yellowish hue when I use the flash and the distance is a little long
love, love, love this point and shoot camera
First off, let me say that I am not a pro, or even a hobbyist photographer
I'm a mom who loves taking pictures of her kids, pets and flowers
That being said - I love, love, love this camera
I have never used a Panasonic camera before and I really like the looks and the high quality feel of this
Using it on full auto, snapping pictures of kids
pets and flowers, and every single picture is beautiful
Not even an average picture in the lot - everything comes out stunning - beautiful color, sharp images with a perfect focus
Pictures taken in low light with no flash come out beautiful as well - in fact, I haven't used the flash on it yet
My previous favorite camera was a Fujifilm FX1, and while I still love it, I think I like this Panasonic slightly better - it seems to be easier to get a nice sharp focus
Both cameras are excellent in low light without a flash,  but in this scenario I think the Fuji has slighlty less noise and a teensy bit better color saturation
The best thing about this camera, is that you can literally just pick it up and shoot the picture and get gorgeous results, the second best thing about it is the zoom - at 60x you can zoom to your hearts content
Perfect for kids sporting events
It is also a little easier to focus at the farthest end of the zoom than I thought it would be
I also have a SonyDSC-HX20v with a 20x zoom, and I think the panasonic is easier to focus at the highest zoom than the Sony is - however both require a steady hand at full zoom
What I like about the Fuji and the Sony, though is that they are small enough to fit in a purse - whereas this Panasonic most definitely is not
If you're looking for a high end camera but aren't ready for a DSLR (or if you have a DSLR and sometimes just want a simple point and shoot) then I would definitely recommend this one
So far so good
Image quality is very good IMO
I still have lots more testing to do in this area however
The 20mm wide shots are amazing
My FZ150 has a 25mm wide and this camera appears to take in approx
20% more coverage
I was able to shoot at max zoom and get good results hand holding the camera
This was in bright sunlight so with less light I wouldn't expect such good results
I really dislike the on/off switch
Hard to move and feels like it will break easily
On the physical positive side the shape of the grip is excellent
The palm of your hand makes full contact with the camera
Much better than my FZ150
I also like the slightly raised Video button and its location
I can find it by feel now
The wheel on the back of the FZ70 is a huge improvement over the one on the FZ150
It sticks out more now and is easy to turn
I've only had the camera in my hands since yesterday and will add more impressions as I get deeper into it but except for the lousy on/off switch I'm quite impressed at this point
Here's my update
After quite extensive testing comparing the zooms on my FZ150 with the FZ70 I decided to return the FZ70
The big attraction for me with the FZ70 was the extra zoom but if I can get the same IQ cropping my FZ150 shots that cancels out the main advantage of the FZ70 for me
Also I found I really missed the articulated LCD that the FZ150 has
It looks very much like the rest
Still, everything seems to fit together tightly and the housing is sturdy
My one complaint is that the screen is not moveable
I find the ability to swivel the screen on my Canon camera extremely useful (high shots, low shots, etc
LOW LIGHTIt is not magical
In low-light indoor situations, I needed a steady hand to avoid motion blur
I took a series of identical shots with both cameras and found the the Lumix had vastly better low-light images, with more detail coming through
While manual settings will give the best results, the auto settings were pretty intelligent
It does not compare well with DSLRs that I've used, but that is an unfair compariso
This is the best I've seen a superzoom do with standard indoor lighting
The flash is bright and good at not blowing out images
BRIGHT LIGHTWith daylight, images are beautiful and sharp
One thing that DSLRs do great is bokeh (keep one part of image in focus, while rest is unfocused)
I was able to get a little bit, but nothing very impressive
On the bright side, having everything in focus is usually ideal for family or documentary photos
ZOOM Wow
This camera goes from a super wide angle perfect for shooting in small rooms to zooming far away fast
So fast that I found it a bit hard to get the zoom just right at first
What a great and useful feature
MACROMacros are very impressive with the FZ70
Even with the lens touching an object, I was able to get sharp focus
This is one thing that a DSLR can't hope to do without an expensive lens just for it
VIDEOWow again
I've taken a ton of video with this camera, and it is always impressive
The processor is able to keep up with the 1080i video at 60 fps with no blur during pans or when recording fast objects
As with photos, the low-light performance is impressive too
The audio is not as impressive, but it does the job
Focus is generally fast and able to keep up, and the use of zoom does not cause a loud motor noise like it does in my old camera
CONCLUSIONSThe Lumix DMC-FZ70 is a surprisingly good value
It works well in low-light and takes videos worthy of all your family memories
As someone who normally goes straight to Canon, I am surprised by how strongly I am recommending it
Unbelievable performance
The capabilities of this camera come across as almost too good to be true
I'm glad to report that Lumix have done a great job
This camera performs really well in multiple conditions
Excellent value for money
Truly Impressive and an Exceptional Buy
I had earlier purchased a Panasonic 18X zoom and was favorably impressed with its optics and functionality
I waited for the next Panasonic, even while other powerful zooms made their appearance, because I had a hunch it would be worthwhile to do so
Indeed it was, I brought FZ70 with expedited shipping, as I was heading out to SF to see my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren and I wanted to be able to test it out during the trip
My son, as a surprise gift, bought my wife and myself tickets aboard a tour ship that went out into the SF harbor to watch the America's Cup
Our distance ranged from 1/3 to 3/4 miles from the racing craft and the zoom gave me exceptional photos
Not only did the image stabilization take care of my tremors, it also took care of the rolling of the tour ship
I have a collection of truly impressive clear pictures that I only wish I could share with you
This camera is truly an exceptional value
Excellent quality
I am trading in my FZ150 and replacing it with this unit
The zoom is wonderful and for the landscape pictures I take, it is great
You really don't need a telescopic lens when you have this unit
The picture quality is excellent and the camera well balanced
It is a little more involved than a traditional point and shoot camera
Yet, it is not overwhelming to learn
Buy it and then let the fun begin
You won't regret it for one minute
Takes great pictures
I like the view finder - sometimes it works better than the display - especially in bright light
The increased functionality of having manual controls makes it more flexible than an automatic camera
The long zoom is also a big plus when taking wildlife shots
Unbeatable for dollar spent
This is my third DMC-series Lumix
I love them
For price, image quality, flexibility and ease of operation they can't be beat
I managed a lot of shots in Africa while the SLR crowd was fumbling with lenses that cost three- to five-times (or more) what my whole camera cost
If you are all about heavy, insanely expensive GEAR, buy an SLR
If you are about images, this camera is a delightful tool to use
Great Camera for the dollar
I have a DSLR and I have a pocket camera
The pocket camera does what it was designed to do
Sit in your pocket and take pictures
They were never great but
I purchased the DMC-FZ70 after several weeks of research and I must say I am very impressed
I have had it for three weeks now and I am still finding new features
Shooting in RAW format is great and works well
Great camera smaller and lighter than a DSLR and much better quality pictures than a pocket camera
Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom
The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS
I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm)
Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it
Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light
I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps
Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality
Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as "used" which are in fact open box
I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home
I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship
If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use
If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom
Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool
IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality
I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use
My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show
Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing
I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400
Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear
I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake
I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS
I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod
Cons:Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control
Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light
Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries
Best all purpose camera with an affordable price
Finally purchased FZ70 and quickly verified how great was the power zoom  beyond the optical range at 132X
The camera does have good zoom power but the picture quality is not what I had expected
It is also difficult to get clear focus when using the zoom
Great camera--great price
This is a very good camera in all respects, and great value for the money
It could use a vari-angle lens, but that's about my only suggestion at this point
Wow zoom
My example of the FZ-70 took noticeably soft, blurry pictures particularly at the end of its zoom range
The images are not at all noise-free: it is ridiculous to market them as such
It has average shooting performance, slower than other cameras in the Panasonic line, not at all blazing fast
As as all-around mega-zoom, the similarly priced Canon SX-50 puts it to shame in IQ, image stabilization, better scene modes, a better (articulated) LCD, Zoom Assist / Zoom Framing Assist Lock, much better factory software, and so forth
Several cameras are as good or better performers, for less money
Several cameras are far superior in performance and features at similar price points
Great Pics
Have taken several pics in last 4-5 days and besides at first not knowing much about the camera it has done a great job as I learn more about all its abilitys
Fabulous zoom
Camera is great for nature photography, The camera has excellent Macro capabilities
Accessories are also available
Poor quality for zoom
Expectations of the zoom were probably too high for a point and shoot
This camera did not stand up to good quality photos
Slow camera also
I returned it for a full refund due to be so disappointed
Canon has a much better processor in it
Amazing zoom
The camera was larger than expected, But once I started using the different options I was amazed by the quality of the pictures and ease of use
I can't wait for my next vacation
Delighted with this product
Buy one & go out and take some amazing photos
Exactly what I wanted
and Panasonic delivered
I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like
it fits perfectly
The camera fits into a standard camera case
and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool
The onboard menu is easy to understand
something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING
easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag
As  I previous said it fits my hand well
that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers
One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access
and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED
but this isn't what your interested in
The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it
I has a very easy to sue Panorama option
and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos
( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do
Videos are NICE
bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic
I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom
The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about
First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well
It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark
Obviously this only works up to a point
I always shoot with the the red label (iA)
you have nothing to lose and much to gain
This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream "manipulation" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening
The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good
It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47
Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc
However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal
If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called "pixel peeper", don't get this camera
Spend the money and get a DSLR with a good lens or two
I did not intend to use the digital zoom but did so by accident and was amazed at the quality when compared to the optical at 60x
Worth every penny and easy to use for the novice
Nice camera for the money
Although I only have had this a few weeks it is a very nice camera
The zoom features are awesome it will amaze you how good of images at max zoom even when hand held
The only thing I am not sure of is the selector/adjustor wheel if this mechanism proves to be reliable then I think we have another winner here
Such A Small Package
So much in such a small package
It will be awhile before I get to use all the features that this camera has to offer
It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp
The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics
Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling
Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do
a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier
For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera
Great value, Awsome zoom
Let's me take the great extreme telephoto & wide angle shots with little WA distortion & minor chromatic aberration at extreme tele
I took the camera on vacation and loved having it
The zoom was amazing
The super wide angle is rather unique in a super zoom and great for landscapes and indoor shots
These features are nice to have but really not necessary features for the beginner or someone like myself with other cameras0
I was able to get sharp hand held images at 60X zoom most of the time
It should be impossible to do that but with some extra bracing, the sharp images were close to all of the time
I think the Panasonic FZ150/FZ200 has the best image quality for the bridge cameras but there is not a huge difference
Missing features&#8230;
The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide
Lots of Zoom
Low Noise
It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use
Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels
This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well
What a joke
Its the worst camera ever pictures quality are the worst and everything about this camera is a joke
Great Camera
"meh" interface
Absolutely LOVE this camera
The only reason it didn't get a 5th star is because of the camera software inside
its definitely not the best I've experienced
Its difficult to navigate through the menus, but everything is basic enough that if you just play with it, you'll figure it out
Hopefully Polaroid will improve it in future versions
Awesome Camera though
doesnt show pic right when printed
The camera is great for what it is
You can not buy this camera thinking your going into a serious camera for any serious needs
Its two items; a camera and printer compressed into one
Ive read complaints about size but you get what you get for what your getting
The plastic feel is a nice strong plastic so it keeps the feeling of it being novelty while feeling of good quality
The 10mp camera is great but don't expect much in low lighting
My complaints are that the menu system is not very organized, the print quality is not what was expected (based on type of paper too) and there is no way to reverse printing
Im still researching a way to print items that were not generated by the camera, but this thing would be that much more valuable if it could be 'just' a printer
Over all, you cant complain about this little thing
Its novelty is great and if all else fails, you got a nice camera for family outings and the likes
It is sophisticated looking and easy to work
The fact that is digital makes a lot better then the old polaroids that required film
It is easy to use
I expected not much but the digital files are of acceptable quality
The prints are small and have a sticky back but color reproduction is not always acceptable* (sometimes bueish, sometimes pinkish)
My experience is you get the best results in sunny weather and indoor with flash
Results from scene modes may not give the desired results
A good thing is you only print pictures you like
An extra memory card allows to take more pictures
It is a fun gadget but quality of the camera and prints could be better
*I also have the Z340: if you print a picture taken with the Z2300 on the Z340 it has much better color, so if you hesitate between the Z2300 or Z340 I can recommend the Z340
It is bigger, but a better camera and printer
expensive
Polaroid Bad Business Policy
Hi,I am unable to write a review of this camera because I have only received defective cameras
The second one I received was also defective, however since it was pass the original 14 day return policy, there was nothing I could do about it
Kool Camera
But it'd print one picture and then say load paper even though there was an entire pack just loaded in
The photos were blurry no matter how hard we tried to hold it still
Had to send it back sadly
Wonderful little camera
I bought this camera to use for my wedding
We had a photo guest book so people could take their own pictures and put them in our book
This camera was very user friendly and the quality of the photos was great too
Perfect for our intended use
poor bulid quality
switches are poorly assembled and the chrome ring around the lens feel of prior to use
It did produce good quality photos
Our son is due any day and I know she has been dying to make a scrapbook
well, this is the perfect camera
Ok, so you aren't going to get super duper mega fine picture quality, but it isnt bad either
Its perfect for its size and may I add INSTANT PRINTING? Thats right
Its a cute little camara and I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants that old polaroid feel
Great product for point and shoot and fun that it prints
Love this little camera
Great that you can pick and choose which pics to print
This camera doesnt zoom but I was able to transfer my SD card from another camera into this one and it printed the zoomed in photos
it uses ZINK system different polaroid
its more like printer than polaroid
personally i dont know why anyone would use this
you can just take regular digital camera and print em at cvs or something and will have better quality photos
"  So, I am thinking that I will spread the word about our $180 worthless piece of junk that really didn't take good pictures anyway
Bulky & poor quality prints
I did not like this camera very much
It is bulky to use and the pictures all come out with a yellow hue to them
Mediocre Camera for the Price
I had high hopes for this camera as a simple one for my wife to use
Unfortunately, the camera lacks some key capabilities for a camera in it's price range:No auto focus - the 3 zone focus switch found on less expensive Polaroid instant cameras should have been replaced by full auto focus
My wife constantly complains about missing shots because she forgot to switch the camera back to shooting mode
It's also pretty heavy at 11 ounces with battery and printing paper
The battery doesn't last all that long, especially if you print out your pictures, and I don't see why anyone would buy this camera, if they didn't expect to print pictures directly from the camera
The printed pictures are quite small and the quality is not that good
Pictures with flash are especially poor
So yeah it feels kinda cheap and the screen on the back could be much nicer but it is perfect for capturing the family around the new baby
The camera itself shoots much better pictures than the screen shows and prints are pretty true to color
Also, the camera has enough manual settings to get some really nice shots
I did pull several pics off my computer and loaded them on an Sd card for printing
I am very happy with the Polaroid and reccomend it highly to folks who don't take themselves too seriously
I was able to take lots of great pics & print the picture out & give them out to the guests at the party as presents :) When you buy this camera buy a SD card too so you can have lots of pics saved to camera
I thought the picture would come out at lot better
I have my Fujifilm Instax so, I'll just stick with that
Easy to use
For fun only and not for good quality print
Love this product
It has a slight darkness to it but it has an option to brighten your picture however, the image looks distorted
I'm keeping it since it serves the purpose and I figured if I really want a good quality print, I can just print it from the store
Easy to use Small to carry on
Easy to use  Small to carry on everywhere
Cons of this camera are lighting
you need good lighting in the room or outside in order to have a half decent picture
The biggest problem and most annoying is the door that holds the film in place opens at the slightest touch
The film has poured out so many times its annoying messy and completely inconvenient
the pictures are small but cute
The camera itself is about as good as my cell phone and the colors look a little off
with fabulous features
Easy to use with fabulous features of blink detection that makes ready everyone with open eyes
It's very easy to use and looks great
Cool idea but bad execution
Pros: Prints great pictures with stylish borders
You also have access to your photos digitally as well which is not the case with other point-shoot-print cameras
Bottom line: Not worth it
There are other, cheaper Polaroid cameras that print better pictures on actual film and are much more sturdy
It prints a photo in less than a minute and the quality is exellent
I highly recommend this product for the price
Some nice features, nice to be able to print pictures
Quality is a bit poor
Cell phone take better pictures
Not very high quality images
I use this on a daily purpose for work but would not like to have it for personal use
The photos print with a green/blue hue
Need to purchase memory
Pictures are very low quality
The color on the printed 2X3 is inconsistent, sometimes very orangish
In order to store a decent amount of photos on the camera you will need to by a memory card in addition to the camera
Tempermental camera
I wish I could give this product five stars
It was great as long as it was working
I purchased this camera to take with me on a trip to Africa
I wanted something that I could leave a photo with the folks I took pictures of
The shutter button didn't work
With a bit of effort, a friend and I removed a grain of sand and the camera worked again
i love the camera since the day that i saw it, is really easy to use i didn't have any problem with the camera, the only thing is when you print the pic thre is a space in the end of the paper that is not good is weird
waste of money
Like others, I have found it very difficult to get a decent quality image from this camera
No matter what the lighting is, it seems like every shot I take with this camera is blurry
PROS:1) The Polaroid Z2300 has the throwback design that ultimately made it more portable than the Fuji Instax cameras
Yes, it is bigger than many purely digital cameras but you have to take into consideration that it has the printer inside
2)User friendly memory
I am not the world's best photographer and I wasted many an instant camera in high school due to my lack of skills
Some photos do not show up because they are too high resolution (12MP is where I maxed out
I set my Polaroid Z2300 at 8MP and the pictures come out nice, very little gets cropped in the printing process
CONS:1) Picture quality is not always the best, you have to learn what setting works for what scene
This may be a hassle for some people but since I choose what pictures to print and save, not so much of a dealbreaker, just wanted to point it out to others
2) Battery life not so good when printing multiples
It tends to run out faster when I am just in a printing  session and unfortunately taking out the camera battery deletes the date/time setting, which you have to set before being able to take pictures
Mine came with all these plug adapters for different countries, which may be useful for those that travel, but I just stored them in the junk drawer
I have been able to order some off Amazon but if I run out, I cannot just go to the store and get more
If you want a fun camera that helps you shares memories in a unique way, I recommend this camera
This is a gadget in all the sense of the word, not something professional photographers or nitpickers should get, because you will be disappointed
Figure out if your needs are what this camera can give you, because I am thoroughly happy with mine and will be giving one to my cousin now that the price has gone down
Great Camera
This camera is great, easy to use, you can take pictures and also HD Video, which is just amazing
" When I printed the photo, the colours were washed out, the text on the border was cut off so I could only see 1/3 of it, and the entire image was pixelated
The photos keep turning out blue
Pretty cool camera although the quality of photos are pretty messy
I suggest getting in a store and test it out
poor quality
very poor quality
Picture quality is bad, shutter cant stop action, file sizes are miniscule, the in camera effects look like they're from 2004
Except, it should cost about 100 dollars cheaper
-Sam
In love
I do really love this camera
It's small, digital and you can decide which pictures you want to print, which is awesome in case you take a bad picture
However, it is bigger than i expected, and I don't know if I'm a fan of the entire blue color on the pictures I print
On the other hand I am completely in love with the camera, it's cute and has good quality :-D
Very poor picture quality
Very poor picture quality
I am so pumped to give this to my girlfriend for her birthday
The price is pretty reasonable and thank good the paper is much cheaper then the vintage polaroids
Well I really bought it to have some fun with
It is a digital point and shoot that prints but has some limitations
Many have mentioned build and photo quality
I found both just fine
My biggest issue is limp flash
It cannot overcome dim lighting
But with digital screen you can see and just take picture again under some light
My daughters and their friends liked the photos with colorful borders
A nice add on in the print menu
The SD card slot is a plus
I put in an unused card I had in my desk drawer and it worked after some fiddling in the menu
The instructions are 3 pages and do not explain the menu functions
However, a little trial and error suffices as it is not all that complicated
I intend to carry it in my backpack and play with it some
Imagine at some point soon, it will end up belonging to one of my daughters
In my case, I really love it
This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print
It's great for what it is
Don't expect it to be more than that
It's a great, thought out, fun product
Great for scrap-booking
If you like using your phone to take instagrams your going love this camera
Insert sd card and choose the prints you want to print
Sticky backed photos perfect for scrapping
You can also upload to Mac or windows and print off larger images
Best of all, the instant camera prints are only 50 cents a piece
Not bad for instant crafting
It works great
The quality of the pictures isn't perfect, but they are good enough
It's just some of the coloring that is off when they print, but it takes great digital pictures and I have always wanted a Polaroid and this one does the trick for my price range
So Fun
This kinda feels like a toy, but what cool, fun gadget isn't
Takes good photos, printing is fun
I love how you can pick which pictures you want, add boarders, edit colors
Nothing protects the lens, so I would suggest getting the case
This camera is easy to use
I only have one minor complaint
When I try to delete pictures on the memory card, I can't
I thought the unit was a little cheaply made but hope it works well after I get the hang of operating it properly
it is larger then you think trust me but on a good note it does exactly what they said and it does it's job well
im not a photographer, but i think the pictures come out pretty well
you do have to purchase an extra sd card and more paper refills, but it was worth it
i love it and i would recommend it to many people
Trying to fill a novelty niche, but falls horribly short
I don't mind the cheap plasticy feel of the device nor the rather limited feature set compared to most other point-and-shoot cameras
The come out with a blue-green hue that almost resembles that "vintage" look, but actually comes off as terrible quality from a sub-par and over-priced product from what used to be the most trusted name in instant cameras
What I love about the product is that you can take photos, store them on memory (internal or an SD card) and then print on-demand
You can even print multiple copies
I also like that the pictures are also stickers
It's a great idea for fun with your kids
But these positives don't even come close to outweighing the horrible quality of the printouts
In my opinion, this product is not worth any price
But it would be better priced at around $50 -- not almost $200
That pricepoint is just laughable
We bought a competing product -- for quite less money
It's a brilliant camera, and if you see one available but it
Shipped quickly
This camera shipped really quickly and will be a really cool gift
I am excited to give it as a Christmas gift and capture some memories with it
I am in love with my camera
Before purchasing this polaroid I heard some negative reviews due to the &#34;chunkiness&#34; of the camera or the bad quality photos, although I have found no such issue
In fact, I am enjoying this camera more than almost any one I have ever used
The features are mind-blowing
The paper prints so well that it looks old-fashioned still
Although the model is considerably big, I have used original Polaroid models and I love this one so much better
Chunky enough to fit in your hands, not small enough and fragile to slip between small cracks and break
Disappointed
This camera did not live up to my expectations
Its very bulky, which i guess isnt to bad because it does print pictures instantly
But compared to a regular digital camer this is very poor quality
And the quality of the pictures printed from it are not very good
I returned mine about 2 days after i got it  it was not worth the money
The colors are fantastic on the pictures that I print although they are a little bit off they are still very accurate
The optical zoom isn't very good, its not exactly zooming in
The printing time for the picture isn't long at all usually a few seconds and ta-dah you have a printed picture
You can also select which picture you would like to print which is great
It's not very heavy and really it's not too thick, it's about the length of your thumb (unless you have really, really big thumbs)
Lovely camera, I love it, 5 out of 5
Meh
Kind of flimsy and picture quality is not amazing but it's fun to have for a ladies night or fun date night
awesome
was a gift for teen  who just loves it
It is amazing
all this cammera can do
I would reccomend this to everyone
Poor Image Quality and Clunky Design
I bought this camera as a novelty item but expected something better than a marginal device
The camera's sensor is on par with a 2009 cell phone camera; granted, I didn't expect stellar images and in no way was this intended to replace my DSLR, but I had hoped that images viewed on a computer would be at least decent
Images in low light are very difficult to accomplish and the flash doesn't help with the results (muddy, grainy prints
The 'fun' part of the camera is printing images on the paper which double as stickers - while it is neat to be able to print images immediately, the glitz wears off once you realize that the images fade very rapidly - I took some pictures of employees at work when I first bought the camera and now the images are just blue blobs that resemble the employees
The printing does work, but as others have mentioned, the printing function kills the battery
Another unfortunate feature is that the proprietary charging cable is lost (as in my case), there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get one - I imagine I will have to call Polaroid because the cable is not available on Amazon or the Polaroid website
Of course, at $200, this is a pretty expensive toy - mine has been on a shelf for months and it doesn't look like a need is going to come up for me to want to use it again
I give this 4 stars because it is a bit bulky, the materials feel pretty cheap and it feels a bit like a toy camera
I accidentally bumped it once and all the papers fell out
The power button on top can easily be accidentally toggled as well
I've resorted to keeping a rubberband around the body to keep it from opening
It is only a little bit inconvenient that in order to review your pictures you have to move over the little slider to the playback option, much like older cameras, rather than a playback button - but that's just a minor complaint
Other than that, for $160, you get a fully functioning 10 mp camera
The prints are pretty good, though definitely not film quality
You do get a few cool options, like color selection when taking photos, and a few frames when you print the pictures
It also takes 720p video which is always nice
Takes great pictures
Defective piece
I'm very unhappy with this camera
Obviously I received defective equipment
It only worked when the camera was plugged in
Once unplugged the camera would shut off and not turn on
I was looking forward to using this on vacation but unfortunately was not able to
Bad prints
My prints came out streaked
My friend bought a cheaper one and the photo prints are significantly better and without streaks
Horrible quality
Poor construction, poor image quality
Definitely not worth the $$$
Don't waste your money
IT IS however for the photographer looking for an innovative and unique product with multiple capabilities
then it just wouldnt print at all, even when i wanted it too
Way below expectation
It can just be a toy, not a digital camera
I did actually purchased the camera
and now I'm going to return it
First of all, the plastic this camera made from feels so cheap
I'm not asking for metal material at this price but it could at least be made from just better plastic
It's hard to pull out the battery cover, and all the buttons are very stiff
the battery charger is almost half size of the camera
and you have to connect it to the camera to charge battery, not take battery out
It's really easy to use, which is a good thing
It also provides lots of shooting modes
However, it is a waste of time to go through those modes by just using the stiff buttons
I don't think it's wise to provide so many shooting modes while it does not have a touch screen
I do not like the LCD screen either
I can't find the info from Polaroid's website but I don't think this LCD has a good quality
which slows down the speedThe most unacceptable issue of this camera, is the image quality it provides
When I looked at the image on m computer screen, I can actually see the pixel noises
I've tried put jpg images taken by an iphone into the SD card, but it can not read the pictures and shows "file error"
it is going digital but this product can't even provide basic standard quality of digital images
Not comfortable to handle
It went right back
Be aware that you have to pay the return postage and a hefty restocking fee
I read about it in the NYTimes, which made it sound like manna from heaven
I was surprised the author was not more discerning
its the best ever
Fantastic fun easy to use camera that brings fun to any event
I love it and the fact that the photos have an easy peel back making it fun for collage boards
Neat little camera
Takes great photos
Good value and my daughter loves it too
Only problem is the film has to be purchased online
Great instant print/digital camera hybrid
The camera intrigued me because it functions both as a digital and an instant print, and the prints are pretty good quality
I gave the camera as a gift and though it's fairly large in size, considering it has a printer included I'd say the the size is perfect
I like that you can choose the photos you want to print instead of printing every shot; the photo paper is conserved for the images you really want printed and you can keep others you don't
easy to use
You will need to get a memory card to help with storage of pictures, but all in all a good and fun camera
Note: when you first look at the digital display of a picture, you might question the quality, but when you actually upload it to a computer, the picture quality really cleans up and the pics are great
This is not suppose to be a high end, high resolution camera  - it is suppose to be fun, instant and a great way to have some quick pics
My son printed out a little 2 by 3 picture that he took of he and his brother in law and it is perfect for my wallet
Polaroid camera, an excellent fishing sinker
This Christmas I purchased two items which were both trash
The Microsoft SURFACE tablet and this Polaroid camera
With regard to the camera,its a complete disappointment
The photos it takes on its tiny,3x2 overpriced film are smeary,blurry, out of focus snaps with absolutely no value
In this age of modern electronics, the camera itself is a plastic coated, clunky, over sizepiece of junk with what appears to be a plastic lens
Basicaly made in China junk
Not at all worth $200
bucks in my opinion
A super big disappointment
its cool - but photos are too small
It looks really cool- but the printed paper is too smal and the pictures are very blurry especailly when using the flash light
Love it
I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for a while & received this one for Christmas
Love it
Still trying to figure out some settings, but it's not a disappointment
As a filmmaker, the video option is great to mess around with and, when viewed on a PC, are great quality
Some people have been complaining that it feels a bit flimsy & like a toy camera
Polaroids itself are affordable because they are built to be a bit less sturdy than a regular camera
Love this
Not the Same
Bought this as a Christmas present and the recipient didn't like the quality
Not nearly as good as the original camera, even though it is digital technology
Love this camera
I gave my daughter this camera for Xmas and we love it
At first it looks and feels a bit like the first round of digital point and shoot cameras
A bit bulky with simple menu options
But once you start printing straight off of the camera it is such a rush you're actually amazed it is so compact
It was worth every penny
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the film is not readily available
I've only found online stores that sell it
Here's a tip though
The old POGO film works with this camera and is cheaper than the Z2300 film
i love it
I love everything about this camera, quick and easy instructions for the &#34;how to's&#34; no film came with it, but I ordered it on amazon prime and it was delivered in 2 days
I love that the camera has a digital screen on the back not like the old polaroid cameras where you have to peek through a hole to see what you are photographing
It also came with charges for any country you may be using it in
thank you
Fun for what it is
This camera fits a unique niche
The image quality is just ok as a point and shoot and the real fun of the camera is the printer
It's a tad pricey for what it is but, it certainly is a lot of fun
I've taken it to a couple parties where it does just fine snapping pictures and the ability to print on the spot and hand over the picture is a nice throwback to the old poloroid days
The menu system is laughably archaic but, it does the job
I'm not sorry I purchased it however, I suspect I will only use it a few times a year
inconsistent quality
the quality of the pictures is so inconsistent
most of the time when you look at what you are going to photo thepicture is red
we change settings and do all we can but the picture looks red through the camera eye and thephoto comes out red
other times the picture quality is great but that is very minor
probably 1 in 5 is good
we are very disappointed
we probably are doing something wrong but have not figured it out yet
we were looking forward to many holiday pictures so what a bummer that was
if anyone has any good ideas for us please let me know
at this point i would not recommend it to anyone
and the pictures are really very small
Real Disappointment
We ordered this after seeing it featured on a local tv station's &#34;Tech Check
&#34;  The photos, although exactly as described, are really, really small
And our prints had really bad streaks
We took only 3 shots, and the streaks just got worse
We returned the camera
Horrible
This camera is not what I expected
How can something that cost almost 200$ have the quality of a 20$ camera? The pictures print blue
Low quality camera
Poor quality photos even with the more expensive photo paper
Cameras battery only lasted for a few minutes untill you had to recharge
Steady hand needed
For my company I was the designated photographer for one of our events and they wanted me to use this particular one so that customers can also get a copy
I liked it because I was able to make more than one copy, edit it as well as change the setting
I think it's a great camera for someone who knows the basic of a camera
However, I had a few others doing the photography with me didn't have a steady hand and even though that there's an anti shake it still didn't help them
Great instant fun
I bought this camera just in time for my birthday bash and, overall, it increased the night's fun by the 2nd power
The picture quality was above my expectations and my only complaint is; if it so happens a drink or any other object bumps the picture while it is printing it will cause some smearage or an inconvenient black spot or two
He has had fun with this one
It is a good product and we are enjoying using it
Great Product
My daughter requested this product last year for x mas but unfortunately I could not find it
This item had sold out, but then again it was about 2 weeks before the holiday
This year I was ahead of the game, I ordered right after Thanksgiving and I received it 2 days later
She is very familiar with various cameras since she has been very much into photography for the last 15 years
Bulky, ok camera
This camera is huge
Like you need a separate bag just to carry this (exaggerating a bit)
The printer is ok, most of the pictures have little tiny lines over them but they were printed out of the camera so it's ok, I guess
I bought this camera for my gf since she always wanted one that has the ability to print pictures - but after using it on several occasions I wish I got one that you have to wait for the picture to show up on the paper
The camera itself is ok, again, just ok
The only thing that really stands out about this camera is its size and price point - both of which aren't pros
If you're deciding to buy one of the instant print cameras I recommend you keep looking
i bought the fujifilm instax mini 7s for a third of the price and i'm much happier
this is an okay camera, but i feel that there are better out there
i've tried the polaroid 300 and didn't care for it either
She really likes that the pictures double as stickers
Now for the not so good part
We ordered this product through Amazon but I think they fulfilled the order via third party
So when we got the camera, it had been opened, photos taken on it (digital ones) and you could clearly tell that the quality control  by the third party and amazon is not there
Fortunately the product works and our niece was okay with it having been opened, however we are sorely disappointed that Amazon lacks quality control even with third party dealers
Fun camera, not a fun amazon experience
perfect gift
my daughter loves it, great for that quick spontaneous picture
and then stick it where you want
easy to use
Excellent size, light and high quality photographyBut the price is not suitableI love it for ever and ever
2 thumbs up
I love this Polaroid it was everything I wanted
It's a great size and it prints perfect Polaroid pictures
Very easy to use as well
You won't regret buying this C=
Horrible
I anticipated the arrival of this product for about a week and I was very excited when it was delivered but was immediately disappointed upon using it for the first time
The body is very cheap
It is very plasitc-y and feels as if it will break easily
The LCD screen is horrible quality as well
The pictures look better on the computer than they do on the screen
My biggest problem was the printing
I was extremely excited and looking forward to this feature only to find out it was completely useless
The prints would come out discolored and low quality
This camera is terrible under low lighting and is just overall a piece of crap
I would not recommend this product to ANYONE
It is a complete piece of s***
It's not in the supposed condition
I bought it new, but i got the item with lots of scratches on the screen
I'm really upset about that
I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend on our anniversary
The thing that drives me crazy is that i can't contact the seller so i can request return
there is zero stability control so you have to have very steady hands
Features = zero and the biggest issue I have with it is that it is incredibly latent
from the time you press the shutter activate button to the time it focuses and the shutter goes, it's nearly 2 seconds which is eons
I'll keep this short and to the point
This is a great camera for the nostalgic types out there that like the esthetics of the vintage feel of the modern spin on the old Polaroid cameras
It is not by any means for serious photographers or anyone that wants to take a family portrait
The pictures come out a bit fuzzy and the focus is how steady your hands are
It's fun just to take to a party to record for memories and to actually print out the picture in front on your friends/ family will blow their mind
I use this in my classroom
The students LOVE watching their photos print out
I also use the memory card to print out photos taken with my Cannon
It makes a great photo printer for pictures taken with other cameras
Better than expected
No ink, digital images better than expected, decent low lighting shots
I really can't complain about this camera
Obviously I didn't expect much, but I am very pleased
It's all the fun of a polaroid with the benefits of digital
Around 50c a print it's cheaper than film polaroids
Includes some filters & frames on the camera itself
Uses a rechargeable battery with a tiny life :(
Unsatified with picture quailty
I guess if i bought a camera with a 10 mp, I shouldnt expect much
The quailty of the printed picture is not decent at all
It comes out darker and blurrier
It wasn't as it was described
I would rather buy a nice camera and take the time to have it printed
I would like to also have a instant picture camera but after trying out this one, I think I'm done trying to search for another one
Didn't like it
I thought this would be a wonderful idea for a wedding guest book but the quality of the pictures were poor and it was too small
I was pretty disappointed and decided to return it
It's a wonderful concept in the sense that you can print whichever pictures you want without wasting film like other polaroids and save them
I wish the quality was better
Print outs do not come out clear
I was hoping for this digital Polaroid to have a better printing thatn the traditional, but it was not the case
works great- but low memory/battery
Works well for our purposes, but the memory and battery life is low and the pictures come out off color from what is shown on the screen
Great camera
Usually, it is deemed that low price mean low quality but this digital instant print camera proved it wrong
In fact, it is the biggest reason behind the selection
Tremendous camera with terrific price
I got this for Christmas
I ultimately returned it
The quality and build of the camera is okay at best
The resolution of the screen and low light pictures are terrible
My six year old point and shoot camera gives better quality photos and a better screen than this camera
In the end I can't see how they can justify the cost
It's not worth 200 bux
Don't get me wrong this is a great instant print camera, but it just didnt work like an old polaroid it was more like a camera/compact camera printer, you can choose the pictures you want to print, and view them
also, the photo came out printed, there was no waiting for the picture to &#34;develop&#34; which is cool but isnt polaroid-ish
This camera does take awesome pictures though and is definitely fun
makes for a great toy out with friends or parties
The AMAZING feature about this camera is that you can take the pictures, print them for small cute wallet size instant pictures, AND save the images to your computer like a digital camera
no needing to scan those tiny little pictures :)
Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera (White)
Love it, great camera, lots of my friends and colleagues are impressed by it
worth buying, films are cheap too
Bought it as a gift
Excited at the beginning but get bored and limited by the product
The best thing about it is the light weight of it, pretty convenient to carry
The pictures are kind of blurry after printing
Find it expensive for what it is
pogo polaroid instant photos for art journaling/scrapbooking/travel journaling
Great little camera
Gives instant photo reference to add to journals for art, travel,  and scrapbooking
Highly recommend this item as a tool or memory captured moment
Inexpensive enough to be great gift for young people
Easily fits into my waterproof case for taking out kayaking
After taking a few photos, the mechanism for processing the photos seems to be on the blink and I am getting a white band of mottled colour on the lower half inch of the photo
After twelve prints, I am not getting true colour
The change to a new box of film did not resolve the issue
Therefor, I am returning it for a refund
Wanted to do a replacement, but this seller does not offer this exchange
Will be shipping it out tomorrow and will update for your information when I have the refund in place
Will be posting it with a return notification
Bummer
as it was such a great concept
Bought the printer at the same time, but having difficulty finding a compatible cord for my Android phone or computer, so have not clue if it works yet
I began the review at five stars, but dropped it to three because of printing issues
I don't mind the cheap plastic
just wish it worked
Great, great, great idea
Blurry, blurry, blurry
I'm nobody's photographer, but just about every shot I take with this camera comes out blurry
From reading the other reviews, I'm thinking either I'm doing something wrong or mine is defective
I just got back from a trip to DC where I used my iPhone as a backup sometimes, and I got much better quality from the iPhone
Sadly, I took most of the pictures with this camera, so I have a LOT of BLURRY pictures of monuments and pictures of people whose facial features are not clear at all
I like the idea of the camera (the printing is pretty awesome, if you can take a picture clear enough to be worth printing) more than the camera itself
I'm not asking for professional quality here, but it should at least be as good as my iPhone, if not better
I'm disappointed there aren't more settings (the point-and-shoot digital camera I bought back in 2006 seems to have more) or it's not intuitively obvious how to use them
I've had this camera for about two months now, and so far I would NOT recommend it
awesome
this was a pretty good buy
the friend lovedd ita little bulkier than expected
but i guess that's how it would beit's a polaroid for crying out loud
BAD PRINT QUALITY
Bought this camera for my boyfriend and he was so excited when he opened the box but it is true that the battery does not last long and the worst part of it is that the print quality is terrible
I love my new camera
I love this camera
And being able to have instant photos
And the pouch is a great way to protect and carry the camera andfilm film
old school
This old school camera is perfect for preserving memories and instant prints
a little pricy for being such an outdated version of a camera
This camera is so much fun
I took this to a party and everyone wanted a picture
The quality of the instant prints are just fine
I have also had some of the digital printed and they are very nice
I used POGO 2x3 papers (cheaper) and the premium photo papers (expensive) and can not tell the difference between the two
Holiday Gift
She loves it - compact, clear pictures, very convenient, easy to store in pocket or purse
Disappointed
I thought the pictures would turn out clearer
Doesn't work well in low light even with the flash
I just expected it to be a little better
I'm better off taking pictures with my regular camera and making wallet prints at Costco
I liked the sticker effect of the Polaroid, just wish it was better or a cheaper price
Give the gift of instant pictures to your family and friends right on the spot
It's a must have for our 10 top essentials for throwing amazing outdoor parties
my son loves it
Great for Shots on the Go
Yes, it's huge
The paper is a bit expensive but what I love about this Polaroid instant camera over other instant cameras (by Fujifilm etc
) is that you can choose which images you print out which means that you save paper and have better memories
Can't download photos into android tablet
This camera takes good photos, but I am unable to download them into my ASUS tablet like I could with a previous Canon and other friend's cameras
1 desktop, then copying them to a thumb drive and trying to open the thumb drive in my tablet causes the photo program to instantly crash
Great buy
I love this little camera
I've only had it for a week but I can see it being my best friend soon
Very light and slim which makes it easy to carry
Takes nice, crisp photos with vivid color
I love the movie feature too
The camera is also VERY user-friendly
I am very happy with my purchase
Such a nice camera for a cheap price
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple point and shoot
This is an awesome camera for the money
This is an awesome camera for the money
Easy to use and easy to transfer pictures to your PC
I've really enjoyed it
Like it
Have used the camera already, and find it to be everything it should be
Quick delivery and good product
It's especially perfect for slipping into my purse to have for any kind of unexpected opportunity to take photos
It's simple and basic, point shoot view
Digital
Bought it for before/after pics for my refinishing biz, does the job
camera
This is for my daughters birthday
Hope the zoom is good
Sony is a good name so Feel fairly safe that it will fill the bill
Impressive
Met all my expectations and more, even impressed my friend that such a small camera could take such nice pictures and be so versatile
Third camera for a family member
Two of us had these little wonders
Needed one for a family member that is getting elderly and cannot work his SLR anymore
a 2014 release with NO Orientation Sensor
Normally I don't give items a one-star review, but this one has earned it
This is about the 20th digital camera I've purchased, and other than the rugged pentax optio that I bought a couple of years ago, this is the ONLY ONE that does not have an ORIENTATION SENSOR
In other words, the photos are great for a sub-$100 camera, as long as all of your photos are taken in the landscape (horizontal) orientation
If you take a photo in portrait (vertical) orientation, you must rotate it MANUALLY
really?I can't believe a camera released in 2014 wouldn't come with an orientation sensor, but if you take a lot of pictures, this is a deal-breaker
It doesn't help that the couple of online &#34;reviews&#34; of this camera say that it DOES have an orientation sensor, nor does it help that Sony's website doesn't say anything about it at all
for the money this is a deal
It is very easy to use as well
I didn't realize it came with it's own battery and a charger for it
I've only been playing with it for a few minutes now and I already like it a lot
He completely loves it, I can said is a good camera, nice with panoramic pictures (totally worth it)
Spectacular camera, terrible computer interface
When I opened the box I was initially shocked by how small the camera was
I was almost expecting it to be twice the size that it is, but that's alright because its now that much easier to carry without unwanted bulk
The photos it takes are of stunning quality
Since I do a lot of work on photoshop, I really appreciate the large resolution that the images come in (5152x3864)
You can't really get much better than this for a quality point and shoot camera, and the price is reasonable
My main issue with it is, however, the inability to connect to my computer to transport the files quickly
Most other reviews claim that it has a super fast, user friendly way to import your pictures to your hard drive
I'm finding this to be quite untrue, and it is unlike every camera I have used in the past
Upon first attempt to import my photos, it failed to install the drivers crucial to allowing ease of access to the camera's files
I thought little of it, and tried to reinstall the drivers through the device's preferences, but found that the option was unavailable for some reason
Then every time I connected my camera to my computer via the USB cable provided, it claims that the USB port is not a USB 2
0 port and it cannot send data at it's full capacity, and says this for every USB port on my tower
System reboot after system reboot held no change, and even trying fresh on a second computer had the same issues
You can still look at the files through the computer, but trying to move them or view the images results in windows explorer (Not internet explorer) to crash, causing you to be stuck on your desktop
The camera comes with a link for some application that you can import/view your images with, but I don't want unneeded software taking up space
I now have to go and spend more of my money on a SD card reader so I can easily transfer photos
Until I order that card reader, I have to use a friend's laptop which has a built in SD card reader and move files to a flash drive, and back to my computer, which is a hassle
I don't feel like dealing with returning the camera and waiting for a replacement, because I just want something I can use now
Before this purchase, I was a sony fan, but I am a fan no longer
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
The camera charged and came to life very efficiently
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
All is good with this camera thus far
The Quality is Good
but remember you need the right amount of light to get the Best quality out of the Pictures and Video
Don't forget that, for those that complain about the quality from Any camera, it's a no-brainer
The various levels of megapixel quality is great
It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it &#34;repaired&#34; not knowing what happened
I never sent it it to get it &#34;repaired&#34; for a whole 200 dollars
I hope that Sony didn't do that to this camera too
So far, so good
This is a replacement from the P O S that was a Nikon
Never buy a point and click Nikon again
Service, and quality sucked
Do you hear me Sony
Better make me happy
Great Camera
Great camera from Sony
Took great pictures
I bought it as a gift and I almost swapped it with my Olympus when I saw the great pictures that it produced
It really beats my 16
1 MP Olympus hands down
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
unfortunately we are no longer able to
We received the product and within 1 month it was already broken
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
unfortunately we are no longer able to return the product but want to let people know that it is of poor quality
20
1 MP where?
So i decided to give it a try and buy this one, since 20
1 MP sounds fantastic
The problem is
I do not see that many pixels on the photos, it is so frustrating
I really expected this camera to make better pictures
Remember to buy a memory card too
I could not find the special effects for the colors such as grey etc
This is a very nice camera
I chose it because it is a 20 mp digital
It can easily handle a 16 GB memory card, and it also automatically connects to the computer for uploading pictures
It was also very reasonably priced
Nice looking camera, inexpensive, average photos
I bought 3 of these for my kids
GoodThe zoom works wellThe camera is smallIt has a rechargeable lithium battery
You can download the pictures using USB without having to take the memory card out
Outdoor/well lit pictures look good
BadLower light/indoor performance is poor
Yes it has a flash and it uses it
but it feels like a crutch
My smartphone might do better in low light
This is not comparable at all, in any way, to DSLR
I was hoping it might be 75% as good but sadly it's more like 25% in our indoor photos
Five Stars
1 MP and I can say less than $80 for this 20
1 MP, you can't find it anywhere else
It functions very well
It can take pictures even in the darkest place
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price
Great little inexpensive camera
Ah, my little camera
It is perfect for what I need
I wanted to be able to easily take pictures of items and upload them online
It ivery easy to use and does a great job
I haven't taken a bad picture with it yet
very easy to operate
NOW THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES
NOW THIS CAMERA  IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES AND MOVIES ALSO WONDERFUL
So nice and compact
does a great job at so little price
very nice style
Sony products are the best of the best
Easy use and good pics
I enjoy using this camera
Very simple easy to use, lightweight, and it takes good quality photos
Would recommend for beginners or someone who wants good simple shots of their vacation
okay
I love this camera it is what I expected  other cameras you get it is never what you expect that you get
Fairly Ordinary Camera
I was hoping to get a point-n'-shoot camera that would take wonderful pictures better than my current Panasonic or Nikon P
But it isn't any different, despite the increase in pixels
Nothing wrong, just not that great
I suspect I was swayed by the positive reviews I read
good product
In my opinion some options, like scenes or light setup, should be acessed with the external bottom, without the obligation to go to Menu
It would be quicker to set my preference
The older models were like this
Better than their previous version
Better than their previous version, I like the ease it takes to take pictures and how the auto focus works, you will too, takes great pictures
Awesome pictures
I love how the pictures look :D and its so thing and light to carry around :) Im happy with my purchased
, , very cheap
Pictures are crystal clear; camera is small and compact
Very user friendly
I would recommend this camera to folks of all ages
The price was the best I've seen anywhere
I had an earlier version and got familiar with the upgrade immediately
Great for vacation snapshots
I'm a very occasional photographer, so this camera meets my needs very well
I find it easy to operate
This camera has a rechargeable LI-ON battery, and this is an improvement over my older camera that uses AA batteries
I like the feature that corrects for camera shake, as I had sometimes had blurry photos with my older camera and this is much improved with the Sony
Obviously, if you're a serious photographer, this is not the camera for you, but for me, it's great
I like to buy a less expensive camera in case I drop it in a lake or off a bridge by accident, and this seems fine for the price
It was a great addition
It took unbelievable pictures and the size
I used this for my trip to Spain and Italy
It was a great addition
It took unbelievable pictures and the size is perfect to put in your pocket
Takes great pictures
Very clear
I love the option of taking videos
Very reasonably priced
BUT I REALLY LIKE
IT IS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I AM USE TO, BUT I REALLY LIKE IT
Not What I Expected
I was excited to get a 20 mp camera, thinking it would be even better than my Sony 8 mp 150, but it does not even come close in quality pictures or ease of use
Perhaps I need some time to study it and experiment, but I am disappointed with the picture quality
It looks awesome on the viewer but after the button is pushed the picture is fuzzy somewhat
Not clear and crisp
The features are more trouble to access on the menu,  but may get easier with time and use
The main complaint I have is the picture quality
very excited
Get Camera even comes with a rechargeable battery which is semi charged
This is my first Sony I also have a Nikon D5000 but at times you do not need a big camera so the Sony is great
Good items
is a good article, I arrive on time and in perfect condition, not to be a professional camera takes very good pictures, just make a suggestion, I include an external memory to the article
Perfect camera for the price
This camera is great for all ages
Lots of cool settings, far zoom, amazing quality videos and pictures
It is very small and portable, you can bring this camera anywhere you go
It meets my needs
I am not very techie  so I am still trying to figure out some things
i use it everyday and the pictures are amazing
me and this camera, we go everywhere
A promising camera that under-delivers
I ordered this camera with high hopes after seeing it was the #1 selling camera on Amazon at the time of purchase, and after reading many 4-star and 5-star reviews
The camera I received was clearly the same product shown online, but I feel like I am reviewing an entirely different product than the one I expected to receive
I'll start with what the camera does well: it does fit in the small hip pocket of my backpack, which was a prerequisite as this was to be my camera for long-distance backpacking trips
It does have good battery life, as I was not able to deplete the battery on a 3-day trip with probably 100+ photos taken
It does have a useful, though low-resolution panorama mode for those who don't want to make the effort to combine multiple photos using image processing software
Beyond those few features, I found the camera to be relatively lackluster and uninspiring
My beef with this camera started the very first time I turned it on
I was greeted by a persistent and distracting screen flicker that I have not seen in any other camera
I am surprised others have not mentioned this, though perhaps I received a defective unit
After several hours of use, the flickering seemed to mostly go away, but not entirely
Beyond the flickering, I felt the camera simply took poor photos compared to other cameras I have had, even those with 1/4 to 1/2 the resolution of this one
Pictures were prone to blurring, I would say this has the least effective optical image stabilization of any point-and-shoot I've owned
Also I found the camera to be very prone to silhouetting and washout in outdoor use, and again this is not simply operator error, I am comparing to other similarly-priced cameras I have owned over the years (including various Casio Exilim and Fujifilm FinePix models)
The camera claims to shoot 20-megapixel photos, and I'd believe it by the file size, however none of the 100+ photos had the crisp look when zoomed in to 100% that I expect for a printable photo any larger than 5&#34; x 7&#34;
I found the menu to be clunky, and many basic features like shutter and aperture settings, manual focus (or at least a user-selected Macro mode) were either lacking entirely or buried in some menu that I couldn't find when I needed it
Again I only used it for 3 days, so perhaps these features were overlooked, but at the least I can say that finding them was unintuitive for me
I know it's a lot to ask from an entry-level camera, but even for basic use I am not comfortable with a camera that seems to miss 2 out of every 3 shots
For my money, I think I can do better, so I returned this one
I will be trying a FujiFilm FinePix T550 next, which sells for the same price but has a 12x zoom, and (I expect) better image stabilization
I would advise anyone who intends to use this outdoors, or who doesn't have rock-steady hands when shooting without a tripod, to look elsewhere
I suppose this camera works well for some, but I can't offer any more than a tepid recommendation that it does work
Great little camera
This camera exceeded all of my expectations
It is small, lightweight and very easy to handle with one hand
The pictures are sharp, extremely clear
It has a built in macro lens for shooting small objects/flowers/insects
Excellent camera
great
sony great model camera, delivered ok, little pack, good pricepros: allcons: noi recomend this camera to any
It's not working for me at all when I got the camera it was a picture on it I think someone returned it I need a full refund I can't even contact the seller
Feature-rich, user-friendly, and captures excellent images
what's not to like?First, here's what I've learned since acquiring this camera: even though it can accommodate interchangeable lenses and has an apparently conventional viewfinder, it is NOT a DSLR
Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as "ILCE" ( "interchangeable lens digital camera)
Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing
Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7
5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera
SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera
This offers two fully automatic modes ("intelligent Auto" and "Superior Auto", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode
For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body
Video is captured by pressing a prominent "Movie" button adjacent to the viewfinder
Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera
HD video is captured in the
mts HD format
This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors
Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather)
Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind
With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces
It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera
While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options
The quality of both still images and video is excellent
Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors
Video quality is also very good
The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio
This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook)
One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is "A3000", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number "ILCE-3000')
This camera is currently offered at a deeply discounted price (so if you if are considering it and see it for less than $300
stop deliberating and select it
This has become my go-to for quick pictures, even though I have some more capable cameras available
I Love My Sony
I love it
Its the best camera for the money and it takes beautiful pictures
The picture quality is the best I have seen in any camera I have ever used
for this price that was awesome
for that price this camera its awesomethe quality  of  the picture is pretty good you take a very cool picture in the night with out flashyou can install external flash and lens on the camera its lightcharging its little tricky but you can buy external battery charger to charge the batter quickly
Excellent Product from SONY at an unbelievable Price
I'm not going to bore you with repeating statistics and features many contributors do
I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys
21 Days, one suitcase, I go light
Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies
Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size
People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion
Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400
So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding
One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever
If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it
Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments
This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation
Nice
A little on the small side but the photos are great
&#8230;
Good video too and much moreFor the beginner
Great for newbies
This camera is amazing
It's easy to use and gives you little tips about different tools
It's cheap and great for beginning photography
The Sony Alpha 3000 is a hybrid camera that combines the internals and lens mount of its NEX line with the look and feel of a DSLR
As such, the A3000 does not have a pentaprism/mirror of a traditional DSLR
For camera users who have larger hands, the A3000 is indeed much easier to handle than a NEX3N, for example
According to dpreview
com, these are the A3000's key features:20
1MP Exmor APS-C HD CMOS sensorCompatible with Sony E-mount lenses and A-mount with optional adaptor1080 60i videoBuilt-in stereo microphonesOptical Steady Shot stabilization25-point Contrast-detect AF3-inch, 230K LCDISO 100-16,000 for stills, 100-3200 for video1/4000 to 30 second shutter speeds, bulbSweep panoramaShooting tips, Intelligent Auto, other novice modesHDMI outFor photography beginners and amateurs, this is an excellent buy at less than $400
The main sacrifice in quality is in the LCD and EVF (electronic view finder) which have lower resolutions
These do not affect the resulting photos and videos
Beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
This is a beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
it is a little bit heavier and bigger than what I had expected a mirrorless camera would be, but still way lighter and smaller than a regular DSLR
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera; it is very easy to handle and simple to use
Like it
Easy to use, great pictures
Could use stronger zoom
Good for a novice photographer
Makes me feel like I know what I am doing
Downloads easily to iMac
Great Camera
After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised
You can't go wrong
Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are
Great Camera for the price
The Sony a3000 takes clear, noise free photos even in low light and crisp, bright video
As a 3D VXF hobbyist, I especially like the auto HDR mode and the bracketed modes
In every mode except Manual the settings are easy to find and use
In Manual mode the few available buttons have to pull double duty and getting everything setup takes some time
Seemed like a great deal
Then, only a few months later, it just stopped working
Nothing was done to it and it was sitting on a shelf
$400 bucks for 3 months of use is sad
My daughter Loves taking pictures with this camera
Great for starters
Pictures come out vertu nice and crisp
So much more you can do than just pictures
After researching the Sony A3000, I was really shocked to find it at the price I bought it for
It has been all that I read about and I am very satisfied with my selection
Sony A3000 - great entry level camera at an even greater price
This is the best entry level APS-C camera you can buy at this price
My Nex F3 was very good and takes great pictures, this is noticeably better
The good:Colours are very accurate - better than my Nex 3
Don't have to do any image editing straight out of the cameraImages are sharpLighting is accurate, and the camera resolves high contrast very well in dummy mode (ie Full Auto)It has a Viewfinder
(I could not compose properly in bright sunlight using the Nex 3)
Although small, it is still better than noneIt has a mode dial like a real dSLR
20MP allows me to crop images without losing detailNoise is very well controlledGrip is very good
Body is solid despite what some reviewers said
Light, very light
I can throw this in my backpack and take it anywhere
Softer than the F3Previously in Auto mode, the Nex won't allow you to change shooting mode via the custom buttons; you have to go through the menu system
Now you can change change the mode dial into any mode
Much better
The bad:Viewfinder is smallLCD is not that sharp and does not swivel (I use it to compose not review my pics, so does not affect me
Would be nice to have a better LCD)No thumb wheel
The wheel at the back is OK, but not as inituitiveFPS is slow
Twilight mode is slow when it has to take multiple shots and combine the pictures into one
My Sony HX1 was much fasterBody is a little too large (but this is a personally preference)Custom buttons have been reduced
The centre button is no longer customisable
A backward stepIt is still difficult to find functions in the menu system
The loss of one custom button makes this worse
ConclusionThis is a low cost camera that takes great pictures
Compared to a mirrorless camera like the Nex 3 or 5, this camera is superior in nearly every way except the size
Bottom line, the pictures out of this camera are very good
Looking at pictures taken with a Canon T3, and this, there is no comparison
I bought this camera because of the large APS-C 20 MP sensor, but the 12MP sensor in the Canon T3 renders a better image
This is a camera for the niche market
The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job
I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319
Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all
What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight
With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification
Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line
Now the best part of this camera is the 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor
This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen
It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies
If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom
I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing
One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW
It wastes storage space in the SD card
Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera
Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features
They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality
What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality
It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon
It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around
So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD
For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition
Recently swapped my much heavier Nikon D90 for the much lighter Sony A3000, since owning this new camera my interest in photography has gone through the roof
It is so very easy to use and has a lot of awesome features allowing you to take some really nice shots that would normally only be available for a camera that is much more expensive
I am so looking forward to taking more pictures with this great camera
The Sony A3000 is an interesting animal; although it looks like a DSLR, it's a mirrorless camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you could think of it as a low-cost version of a NEX-5R fitted with its EVF option
The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video
The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR
The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3
5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings
Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX
I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus
)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic mode
Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either
Besides, the thing that matters is the output
Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great
Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting
The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough
Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings
It takes a little more time but that's fine with me
If i want manual control, it's there
but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition
Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough
However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement
As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it
I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it
At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there
I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice
It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either
I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those
Having said that, it by no means feels rugged
I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection
It might survive a knock or two, though
The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting)
In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually
Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top
Lens is capable enough too
It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback)
Great bag with the all-important AW cover
Simply put - the BEST FOR YOUR MONEY
People keep knocking this camera for it's lower res LCD and viewfinder and other minor issues
First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor
To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more
So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues
If you're going to stare at a camera's LCD screen all day maybe this isn't the camera for you but if you want GREAT IMAGES then definitely buy this camera
The whole idea behind this camera is "magazine quality images" for as little money as possible
Incredible sensor
It's a really good choice
Nice pics and versatile equipment
Easy menu and correct weight
Great performance in exteriors and landscapes
for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle
Makes very good pictures
The image quality and price both align to this middle of the spectrum range, and for a 20MP APS-C sensor this is a great value
Interchangeable lens can be a game-changer for someone interested in raising their photographic capabilities and the NEX mount lens catalog is fairly large
However the size camera alone makes it very much an outlier and for travelers of those who appreciate a more svelte form factor there are better options
For example the Panasonic GF3 is often on sale, and in particular with the fantastic 14MM or 20MM pancake lens would give better image quality
comfortable size and style

Excellent Battery Life Good Value
This camera has excelllent battery life
It has great value
it is basically a nex in a slr body
It's really fun to take pictures with
Feels like a much lighter version of my alpha 65
We have already tried the camera out, and it truly is an amazing camera with clear photos
This is a great camera that makes excellent pictures
Yes, it is a fake DSLR
It looks like one, but has no mirror
It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter
In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not
Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer
You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto
The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen
The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime
If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it
You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge
he say the pix are great
easy to use good price thanx
Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000
The first thing you notice is the grip
What a difference from the typical point and shoot models
This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly
That makes taking pictures much more efficient
The second big difference is the battery
It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack
All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge
It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet
The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use
What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take
They are absolutely amazing
Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken
I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash
The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned
There are a couple of things I did not like
One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24" long
I don't think another 12" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use
The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera
And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord
I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord
And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder
The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to
For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen
This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do
There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera
But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box
The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony
But it was quick and easy
Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy
I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera
All in all I am delighted with this camera
This is not for the professional photographer
But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera
The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing
I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be
The charger didn't work
The charger of the battery didn't work, so I need bought a new charger
I didn't understand, but I went in Sony store, but they, only sold me a new charger
From a Nikon D7000 DSLR user
"the lightweight alternative"
It i truly an excellent camera with very powerful features and almost all DSLR type capabilities which you will need to capture the special moments in your daily life
The low light image quality is far better than all other point n shoot cameras and significantly better than those &#34;fit in the jeans pocket&#34; cameras
I am also pleased by the controls, grip, and video quality
The continuous auto-focus while recording an HD video is a highly useful feature when the subject is a constantly moving 14 months kid
Sony A3000 Super Value
This is a great value in a little interchangeable lens camera with a traditional style view finder
Uses the Sony &#34;E&#34; mount which makes the full line of their &#34;E&#34; lenses useable on the camera
It takes incredible pictures and the quality is excellent
I would recommend this to anyone
I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2
I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6
The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark
The LCD screen is low res
And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two
It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6
And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp
It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light
I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap
AF was fast enough for an outdoor event
This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality
Great form factor and amazing shots
This camera is excellent
My daughter took it on a trip and even tho she left it mostly on auto - the pictures and video were stunning
The form factor is nice, great for keeping the camera steady on the go
The scene settings are very thorough - you can choose between night time / day time / sports and many more
My favorite is the &#34;hand held twilight&#34; mode - perfect for getting shots without a flash, just make sure your subjects holds steady
All in all, no complaints
I did notice there doesn't seem to be an HDMI port, but honestly I never use those anyways on any of the cameras I do have one on
ONE FABULOUS PHOTO TAKER
I'm not a professional photographer and I'm on quite a learning curve at the moment; and totally thrilled to have a camera which does as much as this one does
For the past week, I've been reading the manual from cover to cover both learning what this camera can do along with deciphering all the technical lingo
It feels just wonderful in my hands as the grip is perfect even though my hands are small
It's light but it's solid with a nice rest for my thumb
The strap, which is also included, helps this camera to feel nice and secure around my neck
The photos are just breathtaking and better than anything I've ever seen or was able to accomplish with any other camera
When you have a really nice camera, I think you inherently want to learn more about the art of photography and I've signed
Love this camera
Easy to use, fun to explore the settings, takes amazing photos, and it was a GREAT price
The Sony A3000 is the answer to your dreams if you don't want have the time to learn to shoot a DSLR but want something better than a point and shoot camera
I tested this camera on the auto mode and it has totally impressed me
The basic 18-55 lens is great for your daily pictures plus you have the option of getting different purpose lens as well
The camera itself is light and feels solid
The user interface is extremely intuitive and the picture quality is outstanding
It is extremely enjoyable to take pictures with this even for a novice like me
I think that for the price and the quality of the pictures, this camera is one I would certainly recommend
Not sure this is the camera for me,
The price seems good at first but you have to pay a thousand dollars to get the zoom that my little sony has
This camera is harder to hold still for a quick shot than my little sony
Well worth the buy
It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body
So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system
But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc
Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around
Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall
It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well
Currently it seems to be available at some pretty attractive pricing, which would seem to support my impression that it doesn't have a very well defined target audience
but it does make it a worthy consideration if you are shopping on a tight budget
No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment
In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos
It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable
On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don&#8217;t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized
The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested
With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used
Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive
The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers
Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used
Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me
It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject
I found both AF and low light performance very good
It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing
I&#8217;m not sure Sony&#8217;s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently
It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance
This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by
The pictures it takes are beautiful
Im not an experienced photographer but even on auto its amazing
Makes the foray from automatic cameras and point & shoots almost effortless
Relatively lightweight, beautiful shutter response, and the test of all tests for images--at full resolution, pristinely clear quality (little noise in the right lighting)
I know I've still yet to explore everything my Sony has to offer but I'm so proud to share the pix I've been taking with it pretty much right out of the box
Incredible value
Excellent price point for a camera of this caliber
The interchangeable lenses, compatible with the Nex series, make this truly versatile and a great entry into the prosumer market
When in manual focus mode, the viewfinder digitally zooms in to make it easier to find focus
The menus also offer a great set of tips to help new users understand even the more advanced features
Being a mirrorless DSLR, this camera does not have an optical viewfinder, which has it's upsides
On the other hand, the resolution of both the viewfinder and the rear screen are rather low
it was a great deal
love the speed and ease of the features and captures
It is digital but also can switch to the view finder with ease and takes great pictures
It even has built in tops to help you take great pictures
In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera
For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background
Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face
It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it
And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures
In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp
I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR
Very good budget camera, even in low light
I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance
It takes sharp pictures, is easy to use and lets you via the viewfinder electronically or the LCD
The viewfinder picture is a bit less clear than I would like and somewhat small but manageable
What really impressed me was the low light performance which is no doubt due the larger ccd
Even higher ISO were less noisy than some other camera's in the same price range
The camera only shoots jpg or Raw+Jpg , you cannot shot just RAW
You simply cannot beat the value of this camera and lens combination for the money
APS-C chip, interchangeable lenses, hot shoe, 1/250th sync for flash, decent AF speed and accuracy in good light
It's just an amazing deal to get so much
The only drawback is the EVF really lacks clarity
The EVF is full of noise and is tough to see when you are in focus, but the focus peaking feature really helps me judge when I'm sharp
I'm really enjoying having a camera so small and lightweight
1MP Camera - An excellent choice and the price is quite reasonable
I am very pleased with this camera
The images are sharp and the colors are beautiful
The camera comes with everything you need to get started, and includes a very helpful handbook with illustrations and all you need to know about this product
spec looked great until i took pictures, very poor at best, my 10 year old nikon d50 takes better pictures, the video has lines all over it and breaks down in many areas, overall build quality was totally cheap, spend the extra few bucks and get a canon t3 or nikon 3100 both work great, i actually bought a used nikon d5100 from amazon because i already had lenses which helped keep the price down, i don't know about mirror less tech but the live view on the canon and nikon works great, as many have noted the viewfinder and lcd on the sony are useless- love sony products , this does not live up to their reputation
Excellent Pictures
Bottom line is that this camera takes exceptional pictures, but as far as its overall performance, it is trying to fill a very awkward nitch in my mind
It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light
With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions
Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal
I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus
I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial
The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model
The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses
So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes
For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner
Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life
If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder
Does not have hdmi output
I especially love the fact that it is mirrorless and weighs less than a traditional dslr, this has no effect on the picture quality however
I was a bit skeptical because the price of this camera was so low, so I went to walmart to try it out and fell in love
Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos
I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera
I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen
I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000
Took wedding Video with ambient lighting colors were vibrant and at 1080PHD
Nothing looked dark very clear
Included software lets you make a JPEG from movie frame
Still photos at high resolution you can even see stitching in knit sweater
Battery has good staying power
Took 45 minutes of video and camera was still going strong
Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel
It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip
The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner
There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration
Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise
In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera
Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range
It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots
If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy
It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro
You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between
What I observed through the view screen was stunning
The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still
The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true
Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras
Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like
Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between
Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing
It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features
Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port
I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes
No can do with this camera
It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot
There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes
Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC
However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion
In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise
Super pictures and nice feature set all at a reasonable price
So far after a few months of owning this unit, I have no issues and am having fun with it
This is a great camera for the price and it take great pictures
Nice photos
Easy to use and color image is fantastic
Sharp image
More than I expected for a SLR cheap camera
The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use
In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever
I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it
The adapter for these is always on the camera
The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus
This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens
It even exposes the flash correctly
In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you
Good value
The images were superb and the ease of operation was perfect for my armature skill level
I would recommend this product to the  non-professional who simply wants great pictures and video
Very good and reliable cameraQuality of picture is so nice and easy to useNice body too Thanks sony
I think this was the best idea to come up with this camera along with the lens together as a bundle deal
Easy to use, great pictures
This camera that takes high resolution pictures, vivid colors, is reasonably priced
A great upgrade for me, all my family pictures, inside/outside are much better
The best mirrorless camera I've used to-date
If you're on a budget and want to get an interchangeable lens camera without necessarily going full DSLR, this nicely fits in your niche
It's not entirely on par with a proper DSLR, but they're getting there
If you currently shoot DSLRs, this is a good camera for when you want something light and simple to pack along with you rather than bringing all your gear
The things that jumped out at me most:+Excellent image quality from a proper sensor, little noise at 1600 ISO or lower
+Good weight and balance, feels sturdy, unlike the Sony fixed-lens cameras I've tested recently+Quiet operation+Good Battery Life+Proper manual and priority modes-Underwhelming viewfinder and LCD panel on the back-Slow and sometimes flakey autofocus when not in broad daylight-Forcing JPG to save with RAW
If I'm shooting RAW, I want RAW only, adding JPGs just reduces available cache and storage and increases write time
400$? Really? Sony is surely losing money on this camera
They are selling this camera at such a lower price only because they want their customers to invest in their great lenses later
Comes with a decent kit lens that alone should have cost 200$
Soo basically you are getting an apsc camera body for 200$
I think this is the bergain of the century
Nothing is free these days but this surely comes close
Cheap, light, good sensor, but that's about it
The camera is light and has a great sensor, but it's a pain to shoot
) Combined with the fact that one has to constantly switch between LCD and viewfinder by pressing a button, the low quality of the LCD and the viewfinder (the latter being horrible) makes taking pics with this camera a frustrating experience
Favorable reviews insist on the excellent price of this camera
Sure, it's cheap, but I've recently seen dslr's selling for $50-70 more (new)
Other things:(a) contrary to the good impression many reviewers have of the Sony 18-55, I found the lens to severely lack in sharpness, especially at the borders;(b) the sensor is very nice, but a bit noisier than my 16mp Pentax K-30;(c) the camera comes with a small brochure, but you'll have to download the more comprehensive handbook from Sony's website;(d) no charger, either--you can charge the camera directly or buy a charger;(e) I found the menu fairly difficult to navigate
Very good image quality/Good feature set for the price
What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it
I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip
Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact
But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature
The LCD has painfully low resolution
I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K
Image quality is very good
After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji
I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji
Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds
I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels
I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers
But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money
It only shoots at 3
A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000
- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact
EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway
- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing
But really no complaints for the price I paid($279)
- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size)
- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels
This camera is extremely user-friendly, the battery life is great, and the photo quality, pretty darn good
Great camera for a great price
great idea but thats it
I liked the idea of a viewdinder and a hotshoe,both of which my nex doesnt have
Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing
I now have two of these A3000's
This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options
again all in-camera
that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos
just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done
It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses
The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu
So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000
It is much lighter and smaller than the A37
You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter
or a T mount adapter
You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it
I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job
Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now
This is stupidly under priced
The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations
The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37
you have to push a button to switch between the two
the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line
(the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery)
You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY
Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers
One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like
So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments
This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get
the A37 operates the same way
Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great
for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with
and at this price who can resist?
which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect
The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon
and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR
So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken
and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well
Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting
In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum
This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera
Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well
You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot
heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception
I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either
I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake
The consumer wins big time on the A3000
A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING
I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed
I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point
The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise
This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this
The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built
The -4 to +3 5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera
The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted
This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses
I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice
Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand
The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability
The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing
Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera
This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings
This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera
Great for the price but lacks for video
The A3000 is definitely a step forward from the smaller NEX bodies and outperforms them in some aspects including response
In terms of video quality I can confirm what another reviewer referred to as &#34;fixed patter noise&#34; to be an issue
The video also has more artifacts than the NEX or alpha cameras
The LCD screen is tough to use for manual focus and you cannot see anything sharply through the QVGA Tru-Finder - viewfinder at all, no matter how you adjust the dial
The Price is Right
If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate
I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4
3 OSS Lens for $427
00 total
At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4
3 OSS Lens for $200
00 off, if purchased with this camera
You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality
The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price
The image quality is superb
There is a lot of value in the features
And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later
Currently, it can't be beat
i use this as a second camera
I have an NEX 7, and this was bought so that i could keep my telephoto on my neck while i had a wide angle
For the price, you can't beat it
The Sony menus are a little tricky, but once you have learned how to use, you are good to go
Again, it exists as a second camera
And re the view finder, or the flat screen on the back, if you find these a problem, you never worked in the old days where all we had was a ground glass viewer
The NEX 7 is a must have
The a3000 (also a5000) are probably just what the serious but cheap amateur needs - a second body
This is not a SLR camera
If you are shopping for a DSLR camera, be aware -- this is not the one
It's rather a Sony's NEX camera in a SLR body
You should pay attention to the term &#34;MIRRORLESS&#34; in its description
great camera
It's a great camera although like many new technologies it does far too many things for my purposes
I'm a non-auto pretty much manual kind a photographer and don't like all the special things this kind of camera does
I often find that my fingers confuse the issue without my intention or permission
Once on the proper setting it does take a great photo but I'm not sure I want to be so committed to the thing as to have to take a college level course to learn how to use it
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
great job canon !
yep .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
* main dial is not backlit .
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
flaws ?
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
positives
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
excellent range of metering options as well .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
negatives
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
absolutely breathtaking .
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
the prints are beautiful !
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
this is a great camera for you !
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
warning - i did read the manual !
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
four megapixels is great .
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
it is a very amazing product .
i highly recommend it .
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
takes excellent photos .
night mode is clear as day .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
i give it 10 stars !
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
i bought this last week through amazon .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
i love this camera .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
i do n't think i was asking too much .
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
that meant even less light and just as much action .
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
the grain was terrible .
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
the camera was a marvel .
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
sure .
it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
now what about the flash problem ?
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
i didnt wait to experiment .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
whoa .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
i 'm very glad i did .
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
but who cares ?
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
but canon never fails to amaze .
some of the great gains over g2 --
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
a big plus in my book .
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
big mistake .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
got way too many blurry pictures .
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
the nikon 's are great cameras .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
photos had some artifacts and noise .
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
fiance did n't like the feel .
the canon g3 .
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
why ?
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
i am not talking milliseconds .
picture this :
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
splash !
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
it focuses in a snap .
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
what task do they perform ?
cameras capture moments .
they stop time .
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
so buy the g3 .
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
i love the quality of the pictures .
they look fantastic .
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
many before me have done that already .
i agree with the positive reviews .
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
very cheaply made .
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
the g2 was better in this respect .
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
this camera performs like i can not believe !
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
this camera will stay with me for years !
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
highly recommended .
for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
because this camera is beautiful .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
the g3 looks like a work of art !
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
this is my first digital camera .
i am very pleased with it so far .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
this seemed like a really good compromise .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
it is not perfect though .
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
trips .
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
i am quite happy with the camera .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
excellent idea !
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
negative points :
the included memory card is too small .
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
it is made of plastic .
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
this is not a handbag camera .
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
good points :
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
the image quality is excellent .
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
my story is based on personal usage .
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
the distortion is not a flaw .
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
it 's a winner .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .
so why lie about it ?
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
i cancelled the order .
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
thanks for nothing , amazon !
this camera has a major design flaw .
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
everything else about the camera is great .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
the moveable lcd screen is great .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
negatives ?
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
added 2-24 .
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
very easy to use .
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
definetely a great camera .
proven canon built quality and lens .
feels solid in hand .
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
i love photography .
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
reason for two ?
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
card reader is included .
2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
. lens cap is a really annoying
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
made the camera totally inoperable .
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
audio on video also lacking .
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
a few things that might make it even better :
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
the movie mode is also working great .
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
very large pics take 8mb each !
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
great camera , great investment !
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
downloads are a snap and quick .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
really happy with this little camera .
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
this is a wonderful camera .
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
no instructions .
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
my pda becames a digital album .
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
go get it .
before they are sold out !
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
battery life is ok .
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
the quality is superb .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
they take excellent macro shots as well .
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
the picturers are amazing .
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
anybody can explain that ?
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
great camera .
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
it takes great pictures .
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
now where did i put that manual ?
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
buy this camera and savour it .
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
read the directions !
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
had it for a week .
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
seriously ! i love it !
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
but this camera is great !
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
a card with more memory is a must .
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
7 picture quality is excellent .
8 battery life is excellent .
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
10 great price for all the features .
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
there is usb , though .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
it 's no problem for me personally .
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office ñ where no one goes but me.
When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
This camera is truely superb.
The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
Some more manual control would have been nice.
And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
 I went out and got the Canon today.
WOW! Big difference!
I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
Sharper pictures.
More detail. More natural color.
The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
Good image quality.
I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
Wrong, except that my problems are different.
Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
Stored in a padded case.
Never abused.
After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
All had the same results.
Camera is a paper weight.
Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
Expected better from a $500 unit.
I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
This camera is bulletproof.
It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
start up is so quick ñ
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
i just thought it's cute and cool =)
 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
(i can't help but play with the camera always)
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
But believe me, it's well worth it.
Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
Buy it, you will love it.....
As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
However, it was not so in my case.
$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
Who knowsÖ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
The size of the camera is perfect.
Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
I Was wrong.
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
In good light and low light the things a champ.
I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
You will not be dissapointed!
This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
The photo quality is amazing.
it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
Highly recommended.
As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
 am so glad I bought this camera.
All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
The included software removes any red eye easily.
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
The buttons are rather stiff.
I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
The manual is excellent.
Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
Check this one out for yourself for sure!
I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
I love the camera.
This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
The camera responce is VERY quick.
Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
that u missed in the mirror!
Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
And the video quality is amazing.
On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
An A++!!!
I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
I'd say that this camera is perfect.
OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
I take it with me everywhere,literally,
it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
However, I do have a few things to complain about...
First off, the battery.
This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
Very wrong.
The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
The flash is very weak.
Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
it's not my first choice in cameras,
I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
I have had this little gem for four months now.
It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
1) It is perhaps too small.
I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
It is hot enough to be annoying.
Canon says it's normal.
I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
I have used many digital cameras.
This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
Hate to wait between shots
Download it fast to your computer
Have a great and easy to use bundled software
Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
I love this camera.
I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
I am very pleased with my purchase.
It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
I then realized a major design flaw.
All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
I wrote another review and this is the update.
I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
Here are some useful facts:-
On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
The LCD should be used.
However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
The digital zoom is crap.
Turn it off.
It fits in your pocket.
The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
I take my camera everywhere.
Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
The price is $... more.
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
I love this camera!
 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!

My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
I've been using this camera for a few months now.
A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
Good quality and fun!
I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
Other than that, I love this camera.
The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
I said, can your fancy camera do that?
No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
End of story.
I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
I've had this camera for three years.
price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
I put a 128MB CF card in it.
First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
The included battery charger is larger!
Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]
Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
got this as it flew off the shelves.
Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
What else can I say?
I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
The metal housing seems very rugged.
Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
The panorama modes are wonderful.
Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
It's a little jewel.
1- Small.
VERY smal.
You'll carry it with you every day.
I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
Fool proof.
I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
3- USB kicks!
2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
4- Looks great.
Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
5- Excelent software package.
6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
and i'm glad i did!
I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
Definitely a good investment.
The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]
If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
The size is tiny, which I love.
We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
Thank you Santa!
I bought this camera at the end of August.
With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
I've got a couple of digital cameras.
An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
Positives:
This camera is so easy to use!
I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
Well wait no more!
I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
