This is a great camera that makes excellent pictures
Video is captured by pressing a prominent "Movie" button adjacent to the viewfinder
You really have to check out the creative shot feature
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
With a bit of effort, a friend and I removed a grain of sand and the camera worked again
If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it
We bought a competing product -- for quite less money
It is easy to use, great features, and compact so you can still tote it around everywhere you go
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
The battery life is not very good
I have a video camera for video
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
I then looked at this camera
It i truly an excellent camera with very powerful features and almost all DSLR type capabilities which you will need to capture the special moments in your daily life
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
6 SHOTS w DIFFERENT EFFECTS w 1 push of the shutter release
The prints would come out discolored and low quality
6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
The adapter for these is always on the camera
Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all
The last digital camera I purchased was 10 years ago
The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price
Finding your target in the zoom mode is a little difficult, and takes some getting used to, camera shake can cause some problems, but overall it is an excellent camera
Easy interface and quick response
the picturers are amazing .
i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
Hope this helps thanks for reading this wall of text
Great Camera
Includes some filters & frames on the camera itself
There are so many automatically correcting, errors features that it is well nigh impossible to NOT get a perfect photo
* A new Noise Reduction algorithm is more aggressive on low-contrast areas
Got great pics with the zoom
I was almost expecting it to be twice the size that it is, but that's alright because its now that much easier to carry without unwanted bulk
But these positives don't even come close to outweighing the horrible quality of the printouts
I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
I've had many cameras and this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST implementation of continuous shooting I have ever seen
I am overall pleased with the camera and how easy it is to use
It has 2 panorama modes, 180 degrees and 360 degrees and they're the best I've seen
When you've reached the end of your pan, just release the shutter button
If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it
as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
Good Camera for the price
A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
This Nikon has completely changed my mind about the brand and I will be a Nikon loyalist from now on :)
The camera starts up fast and is quick from shot to shot
I'm very impressed with the quality of the images I've taken so far
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
I was in love but now I am not
Excellent camera
I've taken it to a couple parties where it does just fine snapping pictures and the ability to print on the spot and hand over the picture is a nice throwback to the old poloroid days
Zoom pictures up on stage came out clear and bright
I has a Cannon One Shot prior to the Coolpix that got stolen
Five Stars
Easy to use and easy to transfer pictures to your PC
Best Compact Cameras for zoom
Happy wife,happy life
Very happy with it
To get more detailed instructions I'm going to try the Nikon website
The best mirrorless camera I've used to-date
The t5 seemed to be the right fit for me, more megapixels along with tried and true technology
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
The lens and screen are clear as a bell, the telescopic movement is swift, the video is marvelously simple to start and stop, viewing the video is clear and the sound is super
but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition
The print quality with the zoom is quite good
I ordered 2 Transcend 8g and 4G class 6 cards with camera
-Durable enough for me
Of course, packing more megapixels into the same sensor size causes less light to be collected by each pixel, but on the other hand, Canon stated this new one is a "High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor" and also a new noise-reduction algorithm works more effectively, so such a resolution leap should not cause any noticeable deterioration in IQ
The camera was just what I was looking for
Hate to wait between shots
It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
It's a really good choice
For camera users who have larger hands, the A3000 is indeed much easier to handle than a NEX3N, for example
It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
I have used the Nikon S8100 for 3 months
Nikon COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera is the greatest camera ever
As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it
Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000
Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies
Great instant fun
i love it
Sony A3000 - great entry level camera at an even greater price
But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera
It starts up quick and is very quick between shots
The only near negative is that the view screen is hard to see in bright sun while doing video
I'm guessing they did this on purpose so people wouldn't realize what a battery hog this thing is
The resolution of the screen and low light pictures are terrible
And being able to have instant photos
I've only been playing with it for a few minutes now and I already like it a lot
Video quality is also very good
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
But the pictures are just as good as always
I'm not a photographic expert so I don't know what to call it when the camera enhances photos but it does a great job
The A3000 is definitely a step forward from the smaller NEX bodies and outperforms them in some aspects including response
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
People who drive think nothing of motoring over to the nearest photo store to get their camera's specialty brand specific sometimes even model specific battery
My Nex F3 was very good and takes great pictures, this is noticeably better
Video operation is straight forward and the finished product is great
And then finally on that dial there is the magic M and that is manual mode and that's where you get to set the shutter speed and aperture for yourself
Nearly perfect
Both free
It was just too much for me to tolerate
Downloads easily to iMac
I'm hopefully optimistic
Soo basically you are getting an apsc camera body for 200$
The loss of one custom button makes this worse
It is bulky to use and the pictures all come out with a yellow hue to them
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
Works well for our purposes, but the memory and battery life is low and the pictures come out off color from what is shown on the screen
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera
Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more
Macro and portrait functions work well too
I knew that the scenery there would be more than I imagined
In good light and low light the things a champ.
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
The camera takes clean photos through ISO800, and still performs fairly decently through ISO3200
It was recommended by a friend for the type of photographer that I am and it is exactly as described
Usually, it is deemed that low price mean low quality but this digital instant print camera proved it wrong
My bff got this as a christmas gift and rated it very high
21 Days, one suitcase, I go light
Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal
It weighed 2 pounds but had a beautiful lens
downloads are a snap and quick .
The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen
On the other hand, when wide-open, the new lens provides slightly better aperture
Fun camera, not a fun amazon experience
Great videos
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
We returned the camera
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
The 30x optical zoom (with digital extension up to 120x) is astonishing
I bought this camera from my daughter for her birthday and she likes the one we have which is a slightly older model
I was hoping for this digital Polaroid to have a better printing thatn the traditional, but it was not the case
Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000
I like this one much better
Yes it has a flash and it uses it
awesome
This is my first digital camera and I think its awesome
The first time I had owned the camera less than a week
So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments
I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
Easy to use, great pictures
I just had this beautiful camera delivered tonight
Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
It fits in her purse and she loves the quality
That is, until it started saying "Mode dial is not in the proper position
* main dial is not backlit .
I have a Nikon D90 for taking exceptional photos and that will be the camera I always go to for professional results
T3 is best for still shots and is cheaper, has more battery life
I really love the size, feel and capabilities - excellent zoom and functions, but after only about 7 weeks of use, this camera lens locked and I got the "lens error" message - while on the second day of my vacation in Austria
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
There are only a couple of minute issues I have with it overall
And it records full 1080p HD video
This camera is so easy to use!
Great Camera
, 2)the camera is more bulky than I would have liked
Most expensive point & shoot I have owned
Cool camera
I know it won't be a Nikon
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
Deleting images is even slow
It takes great pictures in low light areas and has a stabilization mobilizer
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
The camera has no major quirks or malfunctions, it just works
i just thought it's cute and cool =)
Battery life remains decent but it's somewhat shorter than the T3
Not the Same
Incredible sensor
When it worked, I loved the S8100
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has more features than I need
Better than their previous version, I like the ease it takes to take pictures and how the auto focus works, you will too, takes great pictures
Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
When you have a really nice camera, I think you inherently want to learn more about the art of photography and I've signed
First, the still photos are extremely high quality
Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3
but i guess that's how it would beit's a polaroid for crying out loud
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
People keep knocking this camera for it's lower res LCD and viewfinder and other minor issues
I love this new camera and just started to use it when we went to our niece's wedding in Chicago
Sadly, I took most of the pictures with this camera, so I have a LOT of BLURRY pictures of monuments and pictures of people whose facial features are not clear at all
But it did not last very long before I got the dreaded "lens malfunction"
Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
And the more I play with it, the better it gets
As I see it the benefits are:(1) Small size--small enough to fit, in the case, in a large pocket, or out of the case, in a much smaller one
Perfect
The video is also great just be sure to get a class 6 SDHC card or better and change the options to HQ video and pics(for some reason Nikon defaults to the lower quality)
This camera is currently offered at a deeply discounted price (so if you if are considering it and see it for less than $300
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
However, it is a waste of time to go through those modes by just using the stiff buttons
In efforts to make the camera as small as possible, Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case
The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
Very Amateur Photographer
Don't get me wrong this is a great instant print camera, but it just didnt work like an old polaroid it was more like a camera/compact camera printer, you can choose the pictures you want to print, and view them
For someone who doesn't need professional pictures, this is a wonderful camera
The 30 optical lens is awesome with an option of as high as 120 digital zoom
The prints are small and have a sticky back but color reproduction is not always acceptable* (sometimes bueish, sometimes pinkish)
Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers
Great little camera
It really beats my 16
you have to push a button to switch between the two
I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000
Polaroid Bad Business Policy
Simple to use the camera's many functions
I highly recommend it
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus
I'm a non-auto pretty much manual kind a photographer and don't like all the special things this kind of camera does
Not sure this is the camera for me,
The zoom is great, very simple option menu, great portability, come with a manual
a 2014 release with NO Orientation Sensor
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
I like the feature that corrects for camera shake, as I had sometimes had blurry photos with my older camera and this is much improved with the Sony
Not an Expert, But an Enthusiast
I consider this a major inconvenience that prospective buyers should be aware of
I need to find some time and just learn how it works
These are considered "budget" or beginner DSLR's but in actuality, they are packed with features and unless you are a pro, you won't need much more in a DSLR
The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
Great telescoping lense, big viewing screen, compensates beautifully for movement and has easy to understand settings
0 inch view
Just go with Picasa for photo organizing and light editing and Photoscape for more robust editing
I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it
I was looking for the widest (24-25 mm) with good zoom in a compact camera
Very good and reliable cameraQuality of picture is so nice and easy to useNice body too Thanks sony
It will not take pictures, &#34;Lens Error&#34; comes up whenever I turn it on
Camera is a paper weight.
Quick delivery and good product
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen
I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
i love the camera since the day that i saw it, is really easy to use i didn't have any problem with the camera, the only thing is when you print the pic thre is a space in the end of the paper that is not good is weird
Really love it
I love it
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
I bought it new, but i got the item with lots of scratches on the screen
I took many good pictures -  sharp and clean, with nice colors
I would recommend this to anyone
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face
Now the best part of this camera is the 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor
Although I am primarily a still photographer, I have tried the video on several occasions and find that works well also
I must have taken 300 pictures and at least 6 videos, I use standard Duracell batteries and never had a power shortage
This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
Great form factor and amazing shots
It tends to run out faster when I am just in a printing  session and unfortunately taking out the camera battery deletes the date/time setting, which you have to set before being able to take pictures
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
Very little shutter lag, comparable or better than other good digitals I've owned (Canon A710, 1100is)
Don't get me wrong--this is no high end DSLR camera
Rocky
Awesome camera
A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
A nice camera to use easy to handle takes great pictures used it at a family gathering a few weeks after getting it
)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic mode
Better image quality and fully fix the noise from SX260 video
Nothing wrong, just not that great
But if your main concern is still images, the S8100 is unparalleled
The macro is fantastic in camera and movie mode and I would say that plus the zoom are the camera's best features
Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like
I take a lot of pictures of my granddaughter and she's moving
nikon coolpix S8100
With the camera that is
" I'm not sure what this error means, but we couldn't use the camera
But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
Anyway, it may sound like I'm nitpicking but it is a pretty good p&s
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
Great for starters
I used this camera on my vacation to Costa Rica
I can't find the info from Polaroid's website but I don't think this LCD has a good quality
I definitely recommend the 50mm linked above as it helps learning the manual controls of this camera
The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model
Over all, you cant complain about this little thing
The camera stopped focusing after 1 week
Great, great, great idea
You have to physically spread the lens covers apart until they stay apart
NOW THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES
Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
okay
I was hoping to get a point-n'-shoot camera that would take wonderful pictures better than my current Panasonic or Nikon P
I am not a professional photographer, I don't even qualify as an "aficionado"
Also, the door for the batteries and SD card feels a little flimsy
If you take a photo in portrait (vertical) orientation, you must rotate it MANUALLY
I bought it for my wife as a gift,and she likes it so it was an excellent buy
I know exactly which camera is mine in the group on the table
probably 1 in 5 is good
Excellent point and shoot, with 1 star removing flaw
This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality
Not comfortable to handle
Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers
My Mom is very careful of her things, and even with her being cautious of the camera, After 3 weeks, the shutter broke
I am so looking forward to taking more pictures with this great camera
This camera is great for all ages
Perhaps I just need to go online and find more detailed descriptions
I delt with it because the shots were good and I spent 250
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
Second Nikon S8100 camera takes no better pictures than the Pentax Optio S45 camera that I already have
Low light is very good for a compact, but don't expect miracles
I have had full size dslr and slr Nikons all my life
The self timer and smile timer are great when you want a family shot without having to ask people to take your picture
However, so far I am very happy using the new camera
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
Being a mirrorless DSLR, this camera does not have an optical viewfinder, which has it's upsides
I want to take classes and become a better photographer
It feels like a high end camera and doesn't have that cheap plastic feel
It has tons of extra features for a p&s; and it the perfect companion to my D60
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
that u missed in the mirror!
The new night shooting capabilities are the absolute best I've seen in a compact camera
Sound is good on video, pictures are clean and sharp
Lovely camera, I love it, 5 out of 5
Included software lets you make a JPEG from movie frame
So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes
The best thing about it is the light weight of it, pretty convenient to carry
The price is pretty reasonable and thank good the paper is much cheaper then the vintage polaroids
[EDIT:] addressed in comment, thanks
Needed one for a family member that is getting elderly and cannot work his SLR anymore
Great little camera
I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
The pics come out beautiful but you may need to reshoot sometimes due to flash overexposure or blurriness in low light (pretty standard with these mega zoom compacts)
Same with the gutters on a neighbor's house, and the dashboard of a small airplane
Therefore, the pictures I took with this camera were kind of just point, shoot and pray
Great picks, hard to up load
I also used it for night portraits and they turned out fine, too
If you want manual controls look elsewhere
The camera itself is light and feels solid
I have taken very good care of this camera
Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
The LCD screen is low res
Beware of battery life
I am excited to give it as a Christmas gift and capture some memories with it
I will say in their favor that the pics are extremely good but the two items above make my experience go sour
The optical zoom isn't very good, its not exactly zooming in
Once I play with the settings just right it takes amazing pictures
1MP Camera - An excellent choice and the price is quite reasonable
Easy to Use and awesome close-ups
It takes good pictures, but when recording video, it goes out of focus as soon as the focus is moving (in or out), and in a lot of cases it will not regain focus, the service department has giving me excuses and do not admit that the camera has a problem, that's why I recomend to check more reviews in regards of video before buying it, if you just want to take pictures, get a cheaper camera with the same capabilities as this one, you'll save alot
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
We stayed with Nikon because of past cameras
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
this IS the one
Very light and slim which makes it easy to carry
Now you can change change the mode dial into any mode
I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes
It has a good optic, nice 10x zoom, very sharp and detailed LCD, VR, wide angle lens and a perfect look
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
I found both AF and low light performance very good
This camera is harder to hold still for a quick shot than my little sony
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
It's a bit bulky, but I like how it feels in my hands
Lots of modes and features, I've barely explored some of them
Before leaving, I had some trouble with the lens cover closing, probably because of dirt
Cheap, light, good sensor, but that's about it
All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge
Pros:-Takes amazing pictures, crystal clear even when zoomed out
Like it
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
I have used this camera for about two weeks now and I love this camera
4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
you have to push a button to switch between the two
HD video OK, quality of images better than waited, it's a great camera, good size, good value
I would advise anyone who intends to use this outdoors, or who doesn't have rock-steady hands when shooting without a tripod, to look elsewhere
it takes great pictures .
thanks for nothing , amazon !
The 34x Zoom works great, and is very to  operate
Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
) will do a better job
Zoom
waste of money
Great Camera
It meets my needs
You will not be dissapointed!
I've seen much more expensive cameras that deliver a fraction of this camera's abilities and aren't as easy to use
this is a great camera for you !
Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos
But if you already have a 4/3rds, or DSLR
It doesnt have any manual controls so if you are looking for pro features this isnt for you
he say the pix are great
And for the most part, despite what DxoMark and others say about it, it excels at this task
I find it easy to operate
I love how the pictures look :D and its so thing and light to carry around :) Im happy with my purchased
The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
Purchased this camera to take pictures and video of my son graduating boot camp
I'm new at photography, but this camera is so easy to operate
Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now
it focuses in a snap .
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
People keep knocking this camera for it's lower res LCD and viewfinder and other minor issues
My husband who has never been a picture taker even started taking the camera from me
I am going to work on my picture taking skills, and report back to you after I know what I'm supposed to do with all these bells a whistles
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
Finally, some people complained about background noise while recording video at 1080p
Low light pics: very nice
I am very pleased with the COOLPIX L830
When it came I was petrified to start all the things I had to do to really make it mine
What I observed through the view screen was stunning
However, a little trial and error suffices as it is not all that complicated
Great for starters
The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR
It's everything it promises
I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses
I got this for Christmas
Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
Best camera in it's price range
It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot
5) I can't get the battery to last more than 35 minutes
Body is solid despite what some reviewers said
Best Compact Point and Shoot
You can download the pictures using USB without having to take the memory card out
Camera does everything I wanted it to do
For example the Panasonic GF3 is often on sale, and in particular with the fantastic 14MM or 20MM pancake lens would give better image quality
I had a larger more professional 7mp camera in the past and found myself leaving it behind when I went places with my wife and kids
The automatic mode does it all
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
Love this camera
You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot
The camera claims to shoot 20-megapixel photos, and I'd believe it by the file size, however none of the 100+ photos had the crisp look when zoomed in to 100% that I expect for a printable photo any larger than 5&#34; x 7&#34;
It's a little jewel.
You cannot go wrong with a Nikon
I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial
My photos are getting incredible
Perfect camera for the price
By all other reviews they rank these two camera's pretty close and that would've sent me the other way had I done my research better
I was willing to sacrifice some additional weight and size to get that
Poor Design Choices
I really enjoy taking pictures but I am far from an accomplished photographer
There's much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom, quick and accurate focus, true HD video, relatively good build quality
For $300 you'd think that the camera would last longer
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
)Note:  I first tried the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19
worth buying, films are cheap too
Glad I made this purchase
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
The Nikon Coolpix l830 is awesome, we have been having fun with this camera
I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
I love this Nikon Coolpix L830 because; the more I learn about it the more it becomes an extention of my imagineation
I haven't been disappointed
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319
The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
There are alot, I mean alot of variables you can do with this camera, but if all your interested in is point and shoot then it does that very well as thats all my wife is interested in
This is a camera for the niche market
Definitely not worth the $$$
Also, the auto mode really doesn't handle the flash gracefully--you need to fidget with things to get sharp photos
So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues
And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder
Works perfect as you ould expect
The plastic cover for these outlets is very flimsy and feels like it's going to break off everytime they are moved to plug a cable in
This is the first Nikon camera I've bought - as I have owned a digital sony and cannon in the past
I think this was the best idea to come up with this camera along with the lens together as a bundle deal
I'm still very happy with it
Great form factor and amazing shots
So, now I have put out an additional $104 for them to correct the problem (that they are saying is impact damage, yet it has never had any impact)
Easy to use, fun to explore the settings, takes amazing photos, and it was a GREAT price
That whole full HD video was not HD at all
This kinda feels like a toy, but what cool, fun gadget isn't
You should pay attention to the term &#34;MIRRORLESS&#34; in its description
Although the ability for the camera to take a picture based on the introduction of a face, a face smiling or winking is pretty slick
Now you can change change the mode dial into any mode
I'm sending this back
nice, large display, with the flash location not an issue for me at all
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
I will make sure and purchase a screen protector for the LCD
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between
for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle
And I like not having my camera precariously perched on a hotel window sill whilst charging
owned this camera for roughly 3 months and now its not working I keep getting a lens error and the camera has never been dropped
heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception
then it just wouldnt print at all, even when i wanted it too
The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned
So far I love the quality of the pictures
Fantastic fun easy to use camera that brings fun to any event
The features are mind-blowing
This camera does take awesome pictures though and is definitely fun
There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera
You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY
WHY?  Why why why do they do this?  I suppose it's to be able to have a USB charger but for me this is really annoying
The indoor pics are not dark
but I managed to get a clear picture at night with no light except for that from a tv on the opposite side of a large room
Didn't like it
The zoom is phenomenal
Come on -- please --somebody build a high quality small format for the days the SLR can't go
I would not recommend this camera
Compared to a mirrorless camera like the Nex 3 or 5, this camera is superior in nearly every way except the size
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
So take my review for what its worth
They should INSIST in their literature that you must use their short list of 4 SD cards
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens with an Optical Image Stabilization, which spans an incredible 25-750mm equivalent range in a pocket-sized body, is a significant improvement over the SX280's 20x range
Uses the Sony &#34;E&#34; mount which makes the full line of their &#34;E&#34; lenses useable on the camera
Other than that, it takes great photos and is easy to use
Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
night mode is clear as day .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
It's hard to pull out the battery cover, and all the buttons are very stiff
But the grip bars on the front of this model help
So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments
Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
I don't understand why an in stock item did not ship
This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception
I like the feel of this little camera, sturdy not plastic
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
The wide angle is so sharp, it rivals my DSLR
I sat in my kitchen and took a picture of one ornament on the tree in the family room, and I could see the clarity as if I were right in front of it
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
Excellent Product from SONY at an unbelievable Price
Body is solid despite what some reviewers said
From a Nikon D7000 DSLR user
In the end I can't see how they can justify the cost
Pictures are great the rapidfire feature is very good
This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses
I am very pleased with this camera
If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
It takes sharp pictures, is easy to use and lets you via the viewfinder electronically or the LCD
Imagine at some point soon, it will end up belonging to one of my daughters
A nice add on in the print menu
This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
I use alkaline and rechargeables and may use lithium in the future
Takes awesome pictures
They absolutely love it
The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use
Nice pics and versatile equipment
really?I can't believe a camera released in 2014 wouldn't come with an orientation sensor, but if you take a lot of pictures, this is a deal-breaker
After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji
(Digital single lens reflex--a camera you can change lenses to add a telephoto or a wide angle lens like the pros do
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability
The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
that picture alone made the camera worth it
Have been disappointed with this camera
This will help capture our memorable vacation forever
Some time in this process the camera got scratched and glare spots appeared on pictures where light hit the lens
Give me a scroll wheel to go through images and setting and for God's sake give me a view finder
It also takes 720p video which is always nice
because this camera is beautiful .
All is good with this camera thus far
This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation
Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000
All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
Light to carry
This is a camera that is not exciting in the respect that it doesn't have a lot of high tech bells and whistles but it does do well in the primary aspect in which you would expect a camera to perform well, which is taking nice photos
This camera is everything I wanted
Simple, easy to use
I've tried tweaking the settings a little bit and choosing various scenes but the pictures just look bad
This is especially evident when zoomed to it fullest reach in anything other than bright daylight
MSRP was $299, Sale was $269 and Got it from Walmart for $229, I think she quoted me the wrong price over the phone and had to get a manager override to give me the quoted $229
Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded
But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money
The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
com say they will fit the somewhat more "square" geometry of the S8100 in point-and-shoot pouches designed for the Lumix or Elph
Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
I printed a few shots as 8
I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those
Very good and reliable cameraQuality of picture is so nice and easy to useNice body too Thanks sony
The camera comes with a link for some application that you can import/view your images with, but I don't want unneeded software taking up space
Kind of flimsy and picture quality is not amazing but it's fun to have for a ladies night or fun date night
I limped a long with the camera, taking once in a lifetime pictures with a lens that made it look like the camera had a cataract
I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
This is not for the professional photographer
Best camera I have ever owned
This is for my daughters birthday
A backward stepIt is still difficult to find functions in the menu system
The price seems good at first but you have to pay a thousand dollars to get the zoom that my little sony has
It takes great pictures
The included software removes any red eye easily.
Camera arrived day before H
(the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery)
Fantastic point & shoot
Pictures were prone to blurring, I would say this has the least effective optical image stabilization of any point-and-shoot I've owned
Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now
we are very disappointed
Even higher ISO were less noisy than some other camera's in the same price range
I love this camera, I can zoom and take pictures of all the beautiful flowers, birds, bees, butterflies
I have been using a Canon EOS 7
First let me say that I was impressed by all of the features listed
Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
I am impressed and cant wait to get more comfortable with it
I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
well, this is the perfect camera
Love it
Takes excellent pictures and movies
While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options
I am looking for another megazoom; it will probably be a Canon
And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord
ugly to boot
As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
S8100 is a winner
DON'T BUY ONE
I am told by Nikon that cameras currently being manufactured will have the new updated firmware, but that those on the market now will need the fix
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
They are selling this camera at such a lower price only because they want their customers to invest in their great lenses later
Instead, it is a nice looking but fairly vanilla point and shoot
The features are more trouble to access on the menu,  but may get easier with time and use
Thankfully the store that I bought the camera was able to give me my Money Back
The camera only shoots jpg or Raw+Jpg , you cannot shot just RAW
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
Great photo quality, but durability sucks
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
I can barely turn on the TV anymore
spec looked great until i took pictures, very poor at best, my 10 year old nikon d50 takes better pictures, the video has lines all over it and breaks down in many areas, overall build quality was totally cheap, spend the extra few bucks and get a canon t3 or nikon 3100 both work great, i actually bought a used nikon d5100 from amazon because i already had lenses which helped keep the price down, i don't know about mirror less tech but the live view on the canon and nikon works great, as many have noted the viewfinder and lcd on the sony are useless- love sony products , this does not live up to their reputation
Love it
) Combined with the fact that one has to constantly switch between LCD and viewfinder by pressing a button, the low quality of the LCD and the viewfinder (the latter being horrible) makes taking pics with this camera a frustrating experience
Software Defect
The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement
More than I expected for a SLR cheap camera
My daughter Loves taking pictures with this camera
The image quality and price both align to this middle of the spectrum range, and for a 20MP APS-C sensor this is a great value
The SX700 has an incredible 30x optical zoom ranging from true wide angle at 25mm (full frame equiv)  to 750mm telephoto (full frame equiv)
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
Easy to use
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don&#8217;t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized
Uses the Sony &#34;E&#34; mount which makes the full line of their &#34;E&#34; lenses useable on the camera
The camera in general has good performance in the speed area, although burst performance has only improved marginally over its predecessor
For the recent few years Canon has made great efforts to improve their travel-zoom compact cameras, and the new SX700 is their next remarkable achievement on that way
The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use
It takes good pictures, they aren't the great pictures you've seen by really expensive professional cameras but I really can't complain about the clarity of any of my pictures
four megapixels is great .
Perhaps I need some time to study it and experiment, but I am disappointed with the picture quality
Of course, at $200, this is a pretty expensive toy - mine has been on a shelf for months and it doesn't look like a need is going to come up for me to want to use it again
With great color, good detail capture, decent exposure, and solid (but not class-leading) high ISO performance
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
It was highly rated and true to the reviews
Nifty camera with inherent problems
They are working fine, but Duracells seem to be more predictable
My husband and I travel quite a bit
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars-is because it doesn't have an automatic flash
Great camera so far
I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for a while & received this one for Christmas
And going with a higher end G series would defeat the purpose of "cheaper and lighter"
And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two
Most other reviews claim that it has a super fast, user friendly way to import your pictures to your hard drive
You simply cannot beat the value of this camera and lens combination for the money
All of my photos have turned out great and it's so easy to use
You pay for what you get, and this pocket size camera is worth every penny
FYI: I've read reviews that some were able to pseudo-compensate via manual controls, but when the moment is there, you want to capture it quick
On the other hand, the resolution of both the viewfinder and the rear screen are rather low
Perfect for our intended use
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
Great camera
The gold color is perfect
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
Disappointing
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
spec looked great until i took pictures, very poor at best, my 10 year old nikon d50 takes better pictures, the video has lines all over it and breaks down in many areas, overall build quality was totally cheap, spend the extra few bucks and get a canon t3 or nikon 3100 both work great, i actually bought a used nikon d5100 from amazon because i already had lenses which helped keep the price down, i don't know about mirror less tech but the live view on the canon and nikon works great, as many have noted the viewfinder and lcd on the sony are useless- love sony products , this does not live up to their reputation
As a 3D VXF hobbyist, I especially like the auto HDR mode and the bracketed modes
I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
Mediocre Camera for the Price
First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor
Since I don't like using a flash, it's not a big downside, but I do want to point out that this camera really lags behind in this area
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding
The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
It was fun experimenting with the different scene modes at dusk
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
It doesn't give any info as to what the different scenes should be used for
Ah, my little camera
comfortable size and style
My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office ñ where no one goes but me.
Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing
the g2 was better in this respect .
You will need to get a memory card to help with storage of pictures, but all in all a good and fun camera
I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know my way around a camera
but this camera is great !
Use the USB cable to charge the battery in the camera,  4hrs, OR, get an extra charger and battery and do it that way, you HAVE A CHOICE with the s8100
The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
It looks like one, but has no mirror
Just recently purchased this camera and was excited about using it but had problems with this at my daughters wedding
I haven't used it for video, but he does and loves it
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
added 2-24 .
if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
I wanted to be able to take great pictures of my family and friends, etc
many before me have done that already .
The LCD has painfully low resolution
Received 5/4/11 & returned 5/5/11
Excellent Purchase/Excellent Seller
This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera
Nothing is free these days but this surely comes close
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic mode
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size)
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
When It Works, it's great
It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it
This has necessitated retaking some pictures where the flash was not fully up
The camera served me well for about 2/3 of the trip, but then the lens started to not close and the display showed a lens error
However, when I look at the resulting shot, even those taken with the lens fully zoomed out, I see no evidence of the camera shake that I know existed
Very portable
Zoom is awesome, shoots well in low light and movies are good for close-range
I never use a flash, so the pop-up flash isn't really a bother
Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
Still photos at high resolution you can even see stitching in knit sweater
It is a little larger than our old SD700 IS but fits in the pocket and takes better night pictures
Hopefully they fix that with updated firmware
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
This camera was very user friendly and the quality of the photos was great too
All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
For the price, you can't beat it
Bottom line, manufactures are missing the boat by not having more options with optic viewfinders  in their comoact models
I haven't had the camera for a very long so I am still learning about it, but the camera is easy to use and takes great pictures, which is what I bought the camera for
This camera is amazing
once the light went off in the brain it became a very simple task; however; I did think that all was lost the first time around
This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print
Good for a novice photographer
The S8100 is easy to use and the pictures are extraordinary
I had a couple of issues with this camera
the flash ruins most pics
After researching the Sony A3000, I was really shocked to find it at the price I bought it for
This was the only camera I played with that met the criteria
I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
All you get is a fleeting warning before the battery dies
The LCD is crisp and clear but is mounted flush
After owning this camera for a month and have taken hundreds of pictures and many movies I can say its a great camera for under $200
Also, the fact that the flash was right under where you would put your fingers, made it longer to take pictures because sometimes the flash would pop out under the fingers and you would have to do a double take
I brought replacement batteries and they got me by for another week, and then those died too
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
With the zoom, I got all kinds of great photos of the animals from a distance, very sharp too, some photos look almost as good as my husband's digital SLR with longer lens
WOW
But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
I'm still testing it out, but so far its definitely a keeper
Five Stars
I'm not a professional photographer and I'm on quite a learning curve at the moment; and totally thrilled to have a camera which does as much as this one does
A fine light camera
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
Even in low light, I never had to use a flash
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
I especially love the fact that it is mirrorless and weighs less than a traditional dslr, this has no effect on the picture quality however
If you want a fun camera that helps you shares memories in a unique way, I recommend this camera
The continuous shots I took were a little blurry, but I think with some practice, this may improve
As of this writing I have only had the camera for about three weeks
I was able to drag the manual off the CD ROM into a new file on my desktop, so I don't have to use the CD to read it
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
Its perfect for its size and may I add INSTANT PRINTING? Thats right
They turn out blurry
This is really too bad, but their reputation is shot
In the end, I only kept the camera for the weekend and decided that this particular camera just isn't for me
In auto mode, the image quality is great even though it is apparently capped off at Fine (the camera can take pictures with Superfine quality in other modes)
The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
needed mine, wife had it when i needed it
If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port
Really bought this model because I wanted the 10x zoom feature
I'm still trying to figure out the other features because there is so many
Excellent size, light and high quality photographyBut the price is not suitableI love it for ever and ever
its cool - but photos are too small
I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
Great camera from Sony
I am not very techie  so I am still trying to figure out some things
The pictures are coming out very nice
HOW APERTURE AND SHUTTER SPEED WORK: (The following was taken from my 50mm lens review but it walks you through understanding shutter speed and aperture)Here I'll explain how the f-stop or aperture priority works on digital SLR cameras
There are other, cheaper Polaroid cameras that print better pictures on actual film and are much more sturdy
From a Nikon D7000 DSLR user
Low light performance seems quite good
It took unbelievable pictures and the size is perfect to put in your pocket
Easy to use with fabulous features of blink detection that makes ready everyone with open eyes
Took it out for a test shoot today
I think this is the bergain of the century
The camera itself is light and feels solid
Love it
I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either
Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors
Zoom works really well, better than expected
It only worked when the camera was plugged in
Before purchasing this polaroid I heard some negative reviews due to the &#34;chunkiness&#34; of the camera or the bad quality photos, although I have found no such issue
expensive
This offers two fully automatic modes ("intelligent Auto" and "Superior Auto", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode
Nice
It was as if the camera was constantly seeking focus
Still learning some things
Took wedding Video with ambient lighting colors were vibrant and at 1080PHD
I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice
Easy to use, great pictures
Therefor, I am returning it for a refund
In sum, better buy another brand
I love taking photos
The failure of this S8100 was also at a very bad time as it is at the beginning of time with grandsons from the Mid West
excellent range of metering options as well .
THROW THE CASE AWAY
And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures
Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
I think this is the bergain of the century
Great camera
the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line
I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
VERY smal.
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all
Previously owned the predecesor L820 and like many say from first glance looks the same but there are multi different specs between these 2 so my review is related to their comparison
Sometimes detail with noise is more palatable than loss of detail and less noise
It makes great low-light pictures, something that my old camera wasn't doing
When I try to delete pictures on the memory card, I can't
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
The battery doesn't last all that long, especially if you print out your pictures, and I don't see why anyone would buy this camera, if they didn't expect to print pictures directly from the camera
- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing
I read that you had to manually do the flash prior to purchasing, but I figured I would be okay with it
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are
This is a very nice camera
I ended up buying a Sony 14
a great decision and purchase all the way around
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
Unless you love lugging around a full sized DSLR, this camera will perform 90%+ of what you want while still fitting in a large pants pocket or purse with a simplified user interface and fast startup for quick shots
I've never been so amused as I have been while trying to find things to record in slow-mo
Lens quality is amazing and a nice wide angle minimum focal length
Having fun with this camera
I've had it for a year
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
I bought this camera as a novelty item but expected something better than a marginal device
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
Summary: Video and still shooters--T5i is best, T5 is good
He has had fun with this one
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
I looked at the P530 and L830, and Canon SX510
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
Oh, get it from Amazon too bc it's way cheaper
I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
I would not recommend this product to ANYONE
reason for two ?
Great camera
Digital
After using a Coolpix L110 for work I liked the ergonomics so I purchased the L830 for my personal use
I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
The quality of both still images and video is excellent
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
Have not had a chance to try out the video in detail but the few shots I've taken look incredibly good
You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
These do not affect the resulting photos and videos
But it doesn't have a flat front profile
Gave it five stars
It took decent picture at short and medium focus lengths
Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall
The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video
Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
It might survive a knock or two, though
The flip out adjustable screen makes it easy to keep steady for zoom shots
the nikon 's are great cameras .
The HD video is also super cool
Excellent picture quality
I keep having to put in new batteries every time I turn around to use it
9) The resolution at high zoom and ability to take pictures in low light is excellent, BUT, unfortunately, if you want a clear picture in low light, you have to hold it pretty still, so the image stabilization is still weak
* Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag
The video itself is fantastic and crisp with smooth playback
i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
Not a great camera for action or concerts
Like you need a separate bag just to carry this (exaggerating a bit)
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
my story is based on personal usage .
To get some decent pictures from our vacation I order the Disney photos, which could have paid for a new camera
This camera takes EXCELLENT photos for a point and shoot
It is a complete piece of s***
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
With this said, I am impressed at the quality of photo from this camera
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
stabilization works great to reduce blur
My wife loves the camera, it is a bit tricky with the flash but you can get use to it
only complaint-the neck strap is kind of narrow and uncomfortable, but that's an easy fix
Once mastered, it should prove to be a very nice camera to own and operate
The start up time on this is amazing
Though, these cameras are very similar in their class and both manufacturers have excellent reputations, there was a line up of subtle differences that were slightly &#34;improved&#34; with the Nikon Coolpix L830
Not bad for a non professional or aficionado with a "multipurpose" digital camera
negative points :
It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers
Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features
Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer
The color on the printed 2X3 is inconsistent, sometimes very orangish
My Nex F3 was very good and takes great pictures, this is noticeably better
FlyBoy Seal of Approval
Fairly simple to operate & it's not bulky
It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around
It compliments my Nikon D5000 nicely
We ordered this product through Amazon but I think they fulfilled the order via third party
Bottom line, the pictures out of this camera are very good
perfect gift
I put in the extra memory chip, tho
This camera is excellent
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
I no longer take pictures professionally, so I looked into a light weight camera that at least had most of the bells and whistles
I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
I guess I just need to spend more money if I want a camera that will take pictures of fast movement
I'm a midrange amateur photographer, upgrading from an earlier Olympus 3mp digital
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
The images were superb and the ease of operation was perfect for my armature skill level
yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
Opening the battery door is a real beast until you get the hang of it
Great Camera
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
I find it easy to use, the pictures excellent
I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen
We will take it to local camera shop for repairs
The quality of both still images and video is excellent
Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather)
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
1, It repeatedly report &#34;lens error&#34; and now died
But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc
Oh, BTW, (as others point out) the USB cover FEELs flimsy (I couldn't really care less about this
You can adjust the exposure or just switch it to the exact type of setting you're in, like at a sporting event, or taking a picture of a pet, it's really easy and it takes great pictures
This camera is easy to use
New 16MP high-resolution, high-speed CMOS Sensor
It had more uses than I expected
Love the T/W lens, the scene choices, etc
they look fantastic .
This camera is very easy to use and takes high quality photos
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
and am optimistic that I won't be one that has to go that route
I wasn't okay with it
Just now able to use my new camera after waiting a few days to go buy another card so the camera would work
So this new Canon camera is a very good compact device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording
The come out with a blue-green hue that almost resembles that "vintage" look, but actually comes off as terrible quality from a sub-par and over-priced product from what used to be the most trusted name in instant cameras
We have already tried the camera out, and it truly is an amazing camera with clear photos
If they do fix it, I'll give it to my kids and let them play with it
It's been over ten years since I got my last camera, my first digital one
-Takes amazing panoramas
Love the Camera
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
I am just a beginner in the world of photographn but this Nikon Coolpix L830 makes me feel like a photographer with ideas far beyond my novice station
Camera began to scroll, erratically, at about day 100
Upgrade From Canon SX280; Very Effective Image Stabilization
this is an okay camera, but i feel that there are better out there
Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between
Everything else is pretty standard
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
It's just an amazing deal to get so much
Very good with its focus
Poor camera choice, stick to cannon, kodak, or sony
It's also pretty heavy at 11 ounces with battery and printing paper
Stabilization program very effective
I contacted Nikon's helpsite and they said I must use only the recommended cards
You can even print multiple copies
I'll update in 30-45 days if any issues arise, but it is exactly what I felt it should be, and the $$ is fairly set
The charger didn't work
the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line
Great Camera
I'm not going to bore you with repeating statistics and features many contributors do
As stated in some other reviews, the flash comes up where your finger typically rests, but I have just learned to move my finger out of the way
This year I was ahead of the game, I ordered right after Thanksgiving and I received it 2 days later
The Sony A3000 is an interesting animal; although it looks like a DSLR, it's a mirrorless camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you could think of it as a low-cost version of a NEX-5R fitted with its EVF option
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
We bought this camera in anticipation of a trip to Alaska,  we are thrilled with the ease of use and quality of the photos
It makes a great photo printer for pictures taken with other cameras
I always carry it in a protective hardcase
I found both AF and low light performance very good
I also use the memory card to print out photos taken with my Cannon
Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
The main adjustment to make is in the resolution, the default is 1080, I moved it to 1080*
I think the focus hunting condition with mine may have just been a condition of the unit I received but I don't want to take a chance on another unit
The camera is also VERY user-friendly
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
again intuitive
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
jpg format), unfortunately when shooting against a dslr  with this in
But the pictures are beautiful
The consumer wins big time on the A3000
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
This camera has all those bells and whistles that I wanted in a camera and so easy to use
We go riding in the desert in a side by side and this is perfect for that - small and stowable, but takes wonderful distance shots of the beautiful desert vistas
Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel
I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
Once on the proper setting it does take a great photo but I'm not sure I want to be so committed to the thing as to have to take a college level course to learn how to use it
It is very fast in writing, reading, shutter action, on and off, and preview of picture taken(Quick Option)
The dial is stiff and clicks into place (but doesn't lock into place)
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
Great camera
Excellent Battery Life Good Value
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
I read thru the handbook just to get the basics and it is so easy to use
Autofocus performance is pretty good although it's essentially the same AF system as before
I wanted a camera that was easy to use - no swapping out lenses or tricky settings
I mostly use it for going out with friends and in casual settings (the occasional nature shot)
Basicaly made in China junk
5 star rating for this product, IMHO
so be sure to check it out I think the T3i is the camera to get at the present time
easy to use
A better battery door solution is definitely needed for this camera period, I'd take off half a star on my rating if I could
love this camera
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
I'm not a professional photographer and I'm on quite a learning curve at the moment; and totally thrilled to have a camera which does as much as this one does
No complaints whatsoever
For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner
Best Camera
Got this camera the day before we left on vacation
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
now where did i put that manual ?
Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used
Even Duracells are only durable for 300-500 shots
I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip
The prints are pretty good, though definitely not film quality
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
Awesome 30X optical zoom, fast processing and lots of features
This is my 4th P&S in recent years and is the best
I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection
great camera for the price
Very wrong.
Works Great
The reason I gave it 4 stars is night shooting isn't what I would like it to be, the camera case sometimes opens up on the top, and the battery is very poor even more so if for any reason you use the flash I highly recommend getting a backup battery for it
Amazing camera
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
I don't miss not having a viewfinder, which I thought I would
The low light shooting is great for a point & shoot
I don't do any video, so can't comment on that
The Sony menus are a little tricky, but once you have learned how to use, you are good to go
I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
BOTTOM LINE: BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND GREAT FOR STILLS, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON TRYING TO SHOOT ANY MOVING OBJECTS FORGET ABOUT THIS CAMERA
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
Like that I can replace batteries immediately and don't have to wait and charge them
Its the worst camera ever pictures quality are the worst and everything about this camera is a joke
But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
It's easy to use and gives you little tips about different tools
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
First the tilt able screen is an awesome new feature for those low to ground shots
The included battery charger is larger!
In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever
Love it
This is a very nice camera
- MANUAL FLASH SELECTION: Not only must you pop up the flash manually, but it's a tiny, inconvenient switch on the side where your hand will never naturally land
Cameras battery only lasted for a few minutes untill you had to recharge
The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner
The pictures look better on the computer than they do on the screen
So far, it is the most impressive camera I've owned
Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the photo quality
My wife and I did a fair amount of research and we kept arriving at this particular camera--point and shoot w/ more than adequate zoom,mp's, and it takes a photo quickly--the major problem w/ old camera
My biggest issue is limp flash
either bad lighting, too grainy, and the biggest problem, terrible color balance
What a difference from the typical point and shoot models
really happy with this little camera .
the quality of the pictures is so inconsistent
When the camera detects a flash is needed, it automatically pops up
for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
the canon g3 .
Good value
If you touch the lens when it zooms in or out, it reports &#34;lens error
The only place I could find this camera was on Amazon
Another lens failure
This Nikon S8100 is great camera and does great 1080P videos in every aspect except for 2:1) the FLASH photos shots are almost ALL overexposed and look HORRIBLE
Took great pictures
The camera itself is ok, again, just ok
No stitching photos together, just click and hold the shutter button and turn
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
The Sony Alpha 3000 is a hybrid camera that combines the internals and lens mount of its NEX line with the look and feel of a DSLR
The color is always perfect
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
I needed something less complicated than what I had before so this is amazing for me
Unfortunately the video mike isn't that great, can't pick up cat purring unless right on top of camera & lots of background noise
at this point i would not recommend it to anyone
Caught a gregarious hummingbird in flight this week
Buy it, you will love it.....
Okay camera, mediocre image quality, poor controls
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
And re the view finder, or the flat screen on the back, if you find these a problem, you never worked in the old days where all we had was a ground glass viewer
What I love about the product is that you can take photos, store them on memory (internal or an SD card) and then print on-demand
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
The photos taken in low light are fantastic; much better than I would have imaged
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
+Good weight and balance, feels sturdy, unlike the Sony fixed-lens cameras I've tested recently+Quiet operation+Good Battery Life+Proper manual and priority modes-Underwhelming viewfinder and LCD panel on the back-Slow and sometimes flakey autofocus when not in broad daylight-Forcing JPG to save with RAW
I was just looking for a camera to take decent pics of the kids, and I wanted to stay within the $300 range
It takes incredible pictures and the quality is excellent
unfortunately we are no longer able to return the product but want to let people know that it is of poor quality
Convenient, easy to carry, good photos
i 'm very glad i did .
Way below expectation
Interchangeable lenses are a MAJOR reason you will want this camera
As kind of a hobby, and to get out of the house for a little exercise for my 78 year old frame, I go to a number of stores to shop on a daily basis, mostly 7 days per week
It could be a GREAT camera with the following: variable speed zoom, manual aperatue and manual shutter speed, and a viewfinder for those sunny days
Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing
Except, of course, if you do not choose the perfect thing to photograph
Easy to use
It seems I spent a good deal of money for a part-time camera
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
It has many advanced features for a compact, such as the ability to view a histogram and to look at the information of pictures you've already taken, like the ISO sensitivity used
and i'm glad i did!
This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
photos had some artifacts and noise .
Nikon Coolpix S8100
Twilight mode is slow when it has to take multiple shots and combine the pictures into one
I am also pleased by the controls, grip, and video quality
This is an awesome camera
I have to say this camera has performed way beyond my expectations
You can also upload to Mac or windows and print off larger images
I gave four stars rather than five because I would have preferred a rechargeable battery
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
We live in a rural area with lots of flowers and critters, and they are usually my subjects (unless our granddaughter is around)
Shooting won't take much more time
Consequently, it's very tough to take pictures in the sunlight
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
I have an NEX 7, and this was bought so that i could keep my telephoto on my neck while i had a wide angle
excellent pictures and video
I saw some reviews where this camera did not need a flash at all in dark environments
Definitley puts my buddies cameras to shame, and they all paid in the same price range
Better than expected
It was time to upgrade our Canon 5MP camera so after reading a whole lot of reviews, I chose this one
In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp
for more $$$ of course
We used this on our trip to San Antonio and Corpus Christi and were not disappointed in the quality of the pictures taken by it
And 120x digital zoom
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either
In VIDEO mode the ZOOM is very gentle, like at 1/4 regular speed
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
I love this camera
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
Couple of nice features
00 off, if purchased with this camera
When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall
Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
This is a great compact point and shoot camera
0-Inch LCD (Black)I had considered a DSLR, but thought that this model would probably do almost anything I wanted
The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
I have been using my new camera to photograph action scenes of my new invention, The FlashBak Rear bike light
It is only a little bit inconvenient that in order to review your pictures you have to move over the little slider to the playback option, much like older cameras, rather than a playback button - but that's just a minor complaint
I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
The form fit of the SX700 is a little bit bigger but offers some advance features that make the size increase very worthwhile
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
Random errors
That being said, they do last a long time but be sure to keep some spares
Excellent Product strongly suggested
If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy
And the cool thing is you can get a lot of different lenses relatively cheap for these Canon cameras
The camera would not turn off or retract the lends
The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations
Unfortunately this camera seriously lacks in one major category that is important to certain people
Highly recommend this camera
Battery life = about a day's worth of off and on use while on a recent vacation
The only drawback is the EVF really lacks clarity
I was looking to buy a mid price all purpose zoom camera
I'm a bargain shopper
exactly what it's purported to be
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job
Low light photos look really good so far, but I need to experiment more
My fujifilm S8200 had terrible zoom noise
when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
Just tilt screen up to you and click
The pictures have been greaat so far
I also found the controls annoying, but would have lived with it if it took good pics
If you're going to stare at a camera's LCD screen all day maybe this isn't the camera for you but if you want GREAT IMAGES then definitely buy this camera
we change settings and do all we can but the picture looks red through the camera eye and thephoto comes out red
I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord
Battery has good staying power
8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
Hey, guess what?
I Was wrong.
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
So easy to use that even I managed to get some spectacular photos
Color is great
it was quite irritating
It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
It took great photographs
One of the features I love about this camera is all the special effects you can shoot pictures with
To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
It looks really cool- but the printed paper is too smal and the pictures are very blurry especailly when using the flash light
It functions very well
The one I have is still under warranty, but after reading other people's experiences with Nikon service, I don't know if it is worth digging up the receipt and trying to get a replacement
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
Nice clear picture and great zoom capabilities
Affordable and nice features
I love the option of taking videos
My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro
It's just not worth it
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
Great camera-just what I was looking for and at a great price
This is my third camera,all different brands,but this is great in low light and great if you have a shakie hand
the prints are beautiful !
Get it and you won't be sorry
And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp
The built in flash appears to be movable to simulate a 'bounce flash'
In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you
Great Value
1 MP where?
Most of the icons in the manual as well as on the camera are meaningless?
This is a great camera that makes excellent pictures
If you want a flexible, easy, point and shoot
and at this price who can resist?
Bottom line, the pictures out of this camera are very good
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
Being a brand loyalist, I started with a Canon Powershot SX130IS
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
Cons of this camera are lighting
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
I can't give it a full 5 stars since the battery life could be better
Rather than compare specifications, let me just say what I love about this camera
I dropped my Canon Powershot S80 & got this to replace it
Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life
And our prints had really bad streaks
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
You can just not zoom, and lock the AF to fix this problem
I like having backlit as a mode dial option
Pictures are great
This is an awesome camera for the money
And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
*I also have the Z340: if you print a picture taken with the Z2300 on the Z340 it has much better color, so if you hesitate between the Z2300 or Z340 I can recommend the Z340
Great HD movies, great pictures even at the lower pixels
The camera takes great night pictures - I have had great luck at concerts and outdoors with the Night Landscape (more so than the Night Portrait which uses flash)
This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors
You'll carry it with you every day.
raw, this still won't touch a dslr BUT this probably has the best looking point and shoot photos i've seen across many brands (sony, kodak, pentax, canon, and olympus)
The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
He completely loves it, I can said is a good camera, nice with panoramic pictures (totally worth it)
With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification
I just got back from a trip to DC where I used my iPhone as a backup sometimes, and I got much better quality from the iPhone
The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37
Plus here again, you can shoot your video with special effects
This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting
This is a replacement of my SX260
It's easy to use in auto mode or has plenty of settings for the novis/hobbist that doesn't want to invest a couple of grand in lense's and bodies
Small, easy-to-use, takes great photos and is relatively easy to transfer to a PC
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
I am looking forward to many years of taking photos with my new camera
The zoom was great, the pictures sharp and the price, very good
Aside from that it is definitely worth the money
First of all, throw out the batteries that come with the camera
I am sure I would have been content with the Canon but I love this Nikon
Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
Makes me feel like I know what I am doing
me and this camera, we go everywhere
Be sure to spend some time with the instructions
My husband, the photographer, is enjoying learning how to use this camera after having used Panasonic cameras through the years
This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly
Basically, I downgraded to a point and shoot with a super zoom 3 years ago
My wife and I are very pleased with this compact camera
$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
I bought this to use on a trip to the Amazon to spot animals, figuring I will need the zoom to take good photos of them up in the trees and in a distance
COOLPIX L830
The only complaint I have with this camera is the video
negatives
I also didn't like that the flash is manual
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
For the price is an extremely great camera
good enough
issue I should have known about:- The screen is amazing but I was so enamored with it that I didn't realize there was no viewfinder
My Samsung S5 was used for all our panoramic shots
For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
This camera is not what I expected
This camera is well worth the price
My only complaint would be no viewfinder
I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
but canon never fails to amaze .
The continuous shooting mode is as fast as they describe, but the flaw is that it doesn't work like other cameras
I just release it most of the time
I am so impressed with this camera
The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job
Review of the Canon SX700 with comparison to the older sx280
I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
This is a replacement of one just like it someone dropped while trying to take our picture
It takes awesome still shots
With other cameras you hold down the button and it starts shooting (at whatever its shooting speed is such as 2
]and the scratched lens pictures, many of which were still OK, are at [
I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
I do have only 1 issue
In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos
Nothing looked dark very clear
I anticipated the arrival of this product for about a week and I was very excited when it was delivered but was immediately disappointed upon using it for the first time
Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING
Not even close to a D3, but I wanted a camera to leave in the car all the time
I love this camera
So far I love it
It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip
If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom
Great night shots but washed out in bright daylight
I was a bit skeptical because the price of this camera was so low, so I went to walmart to try it out and fell in love
20MP allows me to crop images without losing detailNoise is very well controlledGrip is very good
I love how you can pick which pictures you want, add boarders, edit colors
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
I hope this long winded review was of some help
I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
In real estate we make pictures in vacant houses with no power and this is a great asset
takes a little practice for those of us used to larger cameras
However, this was my first camera without a viewfinder, and after two weeks, I returned it and ordered the Panasonic Lumix FZ60 - a more expensive camera; but, with viewfinder
I like the weight and feel of my camera
IT IS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I AM USE TO, BUT I REALLY LIKE IT
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
Still small enough to fit into your pocket
But really no complaints for the price I paid($279)
Plus the zoom is smooth and is great when trying to bring in that wildlife that is far off in the distance
I have had Panasonic Lumix models and a Casio
Do you hear me Sony
The LCD should be used.
Does not have hdmi output
I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
On a scale of 1 to 10,  I would give Amazon a 10 and the Nikon S8100 about a 3
Whenever I leave the house, it is in is case on my belt, ready for use
I knew we would not be close so the high power zoom is what made me choose this model
As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
We took it on vacation and then found you have to look at the monitor on the back to frame the shot
I would recommend this product to the  non-professional who simply wants great pictures and video
there is usb , though .
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
I am very happy with the Polaroid and reccomend it highly to folks who don't take themselves too seriously
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
"the lightweight alternative"
I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
It's small, digital and you can decide which pictures you want to print, which is awesome in case you take a bad picture
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
Ineke Baker-Adan
As a filmmaker, the video option is great to mess around with and, when viewed on a PC, are great quality
I had read the reviews for this camera on several websites and the only negative thing I read about was the zoom sound in videos
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
Excited at the beginning but get bored and limited by the product
Battery life is good
However, after having been using it often and seeing such wonderful results, I am very satisfied and happy
Simply put - the BEST FOR YOUR MONEY
All in all I am delighted with this camera
It is digital but also can switch to the view finder with ease and takes great pictures
It ran on batteries so after taking about 1100 pics on a trip around the world I passed it on to a friend who is still using it
Great camera for the price
I just got back from taking pics at my daughter's Christmas program and all of my other cameras I've had there's no way I could get a good close-up shot, they would always be blurry
Boy was I wrong
they take excellent macro shots as well .
I decided to go with the Nikon as we already own a D60 and love it
this is a wonderful camera .
I just expected it to be a little better
Not small and thats a good thing
My mechanically deficient wife is using it so much that I believe I will have to get another for myself
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
Bought it, returned it
Rating the 8100
Professional quality pictures by an inexperienced photographer
I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera
I think I'd do more research on the SDHC Cards before I buy one
Since April, I've replaced them three times
Pictures are crystal clear; camera is small and compact
On the other hand I am completely in love with the camera, it's cute and has good quality :-D
sony great model camera, delivered ok, little pack, good pricepros: allcons: noi recomend this camera to any
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses
The mechanism does seem very sensitive to dust
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
I was looking forward to using this on vacation but unfortunately was not able to
I'm a mom of two small children, I work full-time and I'm a grad student - I don't have time to spend making my pictures better with software
I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it
what a dissapointment
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
I accidentally bumped it once and all the papers fell out
This year I came to terms with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment and decided I would buy a GOOD camera because it is worth the extra $50 or $100 to have the fantastic quality
But with digital screen you can see and just take picture again under some light
This camera comes with wifi transfer of photos, have not set it up yet so can't speak to that at this point
Canon says it's normal.
I did a ton of research on the camera and it's close relative out there the Canon PowerShot SX510 HS
shutter sound5
Amazing camera and I've only scratched the surface of what it can do
In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually
Some have complained of battery life, but I found them to last a really long time
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range
It only shoots at 3
a card with more memory is a must .
The good:Colours are very accurate - better than my Nex 3
The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability
If you're recording something silent, you can hear the zoom a little, but isn't that true with all video cameras?  This camera also has a great feature for slow motion videos
You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
going back to canon
Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
Picture quality is great in good light
People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion
I think that for the price and the quality of the pictures, this camera is one I would certainly recommend
The zoom on this camera is amazing, the pictures I take using the 34x zoom are clear and crisp
If you're on a budget and want to get an interchangeable lens camera without necessarily going full DSLR, this nicely fits in your niche
I always end up placing my finger on top it
One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
works good
Small enough to put in your handbag and works like a professional camera
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
The Sony A3000 is an interesting animal; although it looks like a DSLR, it's a mirrorless camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you could think of it as a low-cost version of a NEX-5R fitted with its EVF option
Lens is capable enough too
A+ and I am telling everyone who wants a nice compact camera to shoot almost anything for a reasonable price
A great upgrade for me, all my family pictures, inside/outside are much better
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
Sony A3000 - great entry level camera at an even greater price
and at this price who can resist?
This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
I can now say with first hand information, that Nikon is now making JUNK
"  So, I am thinking that I will spread the word about our $180 worthless piece of junk that really didn't take good pictures anyway
The lens that comes with this camera is ok but it's lowest f-stop is 5 and that is bad in low light situations
The unit is small, compact, light, with a great picture quality
Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
The only thing I don't like is the case with the magnetic clasp
Sony had great (most important to me) wide angle lens, good telephoto and the very great sweep panorama feature, pretty good screen images, BUT I was astounded how cheap and toy-like the unit felt to me in my hand
This camera fits perfectly between my Rebel XT DSLR, which takes excellent pictures but is bulky (especially with all the lenses) and a small and light ELPH 100HS point and shoot
The wheel at the back is OK, but not as inituitiveFPS is slow
I Love My Sony
Excellent
Love this Camera highly recommennd
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
Never buy a point and click Nikon again
Two problems
used flash as successed
This camera takes good photos, but I am unable to download them into my ASUS tablet like I could with a previous Canon and other friend's cameras
First digital camera
Great Deal Great Camera
A promising camera that under-delivers
Easy to work
The shutter button didn't work
Now as I operate everything I can't understand what it was that was so complicated for me
But a good camera for the price
The pop up flash hasn't been a problem for me, but I can see how it would irritate some people
Top Notch Camera
Photography has always been about compensating and adjusting
second one i bought
I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
I like that you can choose the photos you want to print instead of printing every shot; the photo paper is conserved for the images you really want printed and you can keep others you don't
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
Great camera
This is the best point and shoot camera
Tonight was the best of all - took a picture of the moon - you can see craters CLEARLY in the photo
I highly recommend it
I have yet to swap in the 1700 mAh spares I purchased, but hope they add a few exposures to what the supplied battery can provide
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
and then stick it where you want
BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT THE FLASH
I lost so many lens caps in the past:{One tiny thing I am not crazy about: having to pop up the flash
The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video
I have not yet tested the video so I cannot vouch for the quality there
It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera
I was wrong
The finish feels like it is rubberized or something
Nikon s8100
Got the dreaded "Lens Error" message and it would not work
Interchangeable lens can be a game-changer for someone interested in raising their photographic capabilities and the NEX mount lens catalog is fairly large
I hope that Sony didn't do that to this camera too
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
This is a next gen camera so it should do all of that stuff well and it does
I bought this camera just in time for my birthday bash and, overall, it increased the night's fun by the 2nd power
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
I take my camera everywhere.
If you shoot in dim lighting you may wish to consider something with a bigger sensor, faster maximum aperture and/or a hot shoe for an external flash
Cameras worked fine but you had to hold the battery door shut
This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
It has a very fast auto-focus
She  has shown  interest in photography  and wanted her &#34;first real camera&#34;
com, these are the A3000's key features:20
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
Then, only a few months later, it just stopped working
The camera  failed in ways that have been documented about the 280 elsewhere (see Amazon reviews and the Canon forums)
I have my Fujifilm Instax so, I'll just stick with that
The EVF is full of noise and is tough to see when you are in focus, but the focus peaking feature really helps me judge when I'm sharp
The manual is excellent and well constructed
Incredible sensor
It's a great, thought out, fun product
I took this to a party and everyone wanted a picture
In my opinion, this product is not worth any price
you do have to purchase an extra sd card and more paper refills, but it was worth it
for that price this camera its awesomethe quality  of  the picture is pretty good you take a very cool picture in the night with out flashyou can install external flash and lens on the camera its lightcharging its little tricky but you can buy external battery charger to charge the batter quickly
The zoom works very well
Read all the reviews on cnet and it's definitely recommended
Well worth the buy
I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
Very poor picture quality
It clearly picks up all of the tick tick sounds of the the lens as it focuses
The Nikon Coolpix L830 is no where near as noisey as my Pentax K5 or K30 even if they take batter pictures
Such a nice camera for a cheap price
My Canon EOS Rebel T5 - love it
1- Small.
The pictures are very sharp and the zoom is good
AF was fast enough for an outdoor event
In terms of video quality I can confirm what another reviewer referred to as &#34;fixed patter noise&#34; to be an issue
Love the camera
easy to use
I took one to China with me in 2010 for a short Thanksgiving trip
We were at the Niagara Falls and even the evening pictures of the Falls turned out great, I was surprised
the image quality is excellent .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
I'm not sorry I purchased it however, I suspect I will only use it a few times a year
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
Five Stars
So no putting this camera in the back pocket of tight jeans, which is something I want do often
Battery is Useless
Bummer
I'm happy and I'd get it again
This camera takes crisp quality pictures
I like my camera
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
The 'fun' part of the camera is printing images on the paper which double as stickers - while it is neat to be able to print images immediately, the glitz wears off once you realize that the images fade very rapidly - I took some pictures of employees at work when I first bought the camera and now the images are just blue blobs that resemble the employees
really nice for wide angle photos, which is why I bought it
There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes
My favorite is the &#34;hand held twilight&#34; mode - perfect for getting shots without a flash, just make sure your subjects holds steady
I've had Nikons before
In every mode except Manual the settings are easy to find and use
Sorry Nikon, going back to canon brand
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
Many have mentioned build and photo quality
I love the micro zoom which allows me to take excellent detailed pictures of flowers and any small item
or a T mount adapter
Well I really bought it to have some fun with
BUT it was easy as pie and I am snapping to my hearts content
not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
WTF???Cannot believe Nikon came out with such a bad product
Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
In its small size it packs a sufficiently powerful zoom, excellent resolution and high reslution video
4- Looks great.
Since like most people I got the camera for the still images this is a minor annoyance but still enough to keep it from being perfect
Great camera, good price
The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
With that being said, the quality of pictures taken with the flash down are so that a little color/contrast editing bring the pictures back to top quality (sometimes better than other P&S; cameras with a flash)
Recommend buying extra battery pack and extra SD cards
Can't get it shipped
I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
We decided to go with the Nikon because of the 1080p video, cmos chip for lowlight shooting and 914k pixel LCD
Can't wait to use it on our vacation and take just amazing pictures
Full 1080p out of such an inexpensive and already feature packed camera with the quality it offers is amazing
Makes very good pictures
We leave for my nieces wedding in Ireland in August
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
Great for the price but lacks for video
I liked the weight of the camera and easy to carry with me
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
Others have written plenty about the pros and cons
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
Nikon S8100 P&S Camera
To date, I have been unable to use the Wi-Fi feature to download to Mac computers and into iPhoto
I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
I don't know what the deal is but it makes me want to try a different manufacturer next time
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
For my money, I think I can do better, so I returned this one
It was a great addition
It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features
Excellent Product strongly suggested
I love this camera
I got this for my road trip, and it's fabulouuuusss
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
very nice style
Yep, TRUE
Video quality is also very good
I know it's a lot to ask from an entry-level camera, but even for basic use I am not comfortable with a camera that seems to miss 2 out of every 3 shots
If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
It takes a little more time but that's fine with me
ISO 400 and 800 work very well: 400 is especially sharp
looks nice, works OK
overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
The camera's sensor is on par with a 2009 cell phone camera; granted, I didn't expect stellar images and in no way was this intended to replace my DSLR, but I had hoped that images viewed on a computer would be at least decent
Really disappointing
But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
Excellent Pictures
Nothing but Awesome
Nice
(4) Image stabilization works really well, which I'm sure contributes to (3), but it also contributes to low shutter-speed far-zoomed-out pics as well
great colors , pictures and white balance .
Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting
I wanted a simple but good quality picture taking camera
The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
I have been buying up the best cameras that still use AA batteries because; I have cerebral palsy and do not drive
I added a 50SX about a year ago to have the larger 50 zoom
The camera has significant focusing issues while shooting video especially if you go from a bright area to a shaded area of vice versa
But it isn't any different, despite the increase in pixels
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
Vacation is soon and it's going with me
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
This Christmas I purchased two items which were both trash
-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
So much more you can do than just pictures
With extreme shots, only very minor chromatic aberration and have not noted issues blooming
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
Most disappointed
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
Given the quality of the photos and video I am shooting with the SX700, the effectiveness of the image stabilization, and the camera's portability, I don't hesitate to take the SX700 when going out for the day or traveling
The good news is that sx700 appears to be what the 280 was supposed to be and more, with better quality and no evidence of the same video/auto shut off problems that plagued the 280
It only shoots at 3
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder
I love it
Anyway, Canon has upgraded the battery capacity so we were able to shoot 12 hour days touring the park at multiple stops without swapping batteries, however, I did disable GPS and NFC radios to avoid drain from those features
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
Comparing this camera to the older SX280, both cameras rendered very similar (punchy) photos in good lighting
And the fact that this camera allows you to control these features and so many more manually means you can make great photographs
So far after a few months of owning this unit, I have no issues and am having fun with it
We have 2 yr old Grandson who enjoys having his picture made as much an any 2 yr old
After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji
I write this review with mixed feelings
I am really pround of my choice, this is more that I expected, but the camera is large and a little heavy comparing with the others, but I think is because the zoom
I was surprised the author was not more discerning
Crisp pictures, easy to you use, and the battery life is the best I've come by
Doesn't feel real sturdy so I am still taking my older indestructible Kodak camera along in the rough places we ride which kind of defeats the purpose of replacing it
The charging system means you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it
Easy to Use
The centre button is no longer customisable
It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
Besides, 720p video is plenty of resolution for me
I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance
When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
Multi-mode IS does well for low-light (less shake in the results)* Good results (in auto or "P" modes) with high-contrast shots like shooting directly into sunlight
It is extremely enjoyable to take pictures with this even for a novice like me
It's just some of the coloring that is off when they print, but it takes great digital pictures and I have always wanted a Polaroid and this one does the trick for my price range
4, The images are not very sharp
A thrill to own
I want to make sure I get tons of great pictures
Excellent Battery Life Good Value
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
Eventually the power settings kick in and the lens retracts, but every other camera I've seen has a PLAY setting that doesn't engage the lens
We love this camera
Even the burst shots, HDR and the lowlight shots are quick, you dont even notice how many shots the camera has taken until they process and merge for the final product
They give great photo quality, it has everything you would need for a great photo
You can also shoot stills while recording
I could not be more pleased
pogo polaroid instant photos for art journaling/scrapbooking/travel journaling
My Sony HX1 was much fasterBody is a little too large (but this is a personally preference)Custom buttons have been reduced
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
Excellent purchase
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
The Price is Right
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
I am still learning how to use it so I will have to give it a little more time
Like others, I have found it very difficult to get a decent quality image from this camera
My only disappointment so far is that you cannot shoot super fine quality in the &#34;auto&#34; shooting function
A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING
First off, the battery.
It is lightweight, small, takes fairly good photos, and looks cool, too
Amazing
just wish it worked
It is sophisticated looking and easy to work
One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
The compromise is that it is a little larger but still fits into the front pocket of my Levis (it will fit in my shirt pocket also, but its weight makes it a little uncomfortable there)
No real contenders in its size / price range
easy to/ use
Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal
Takes good photos, printing is fun
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
i use it everyday and the pictures are amazing
The backlighting feature and the night shot feature is AWESOME
Pictures excellent
The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera
There is a thumb grip in the upper right hand corner to help not drop it
This camera is bulletproof.
which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect
I have owned this camera for about 3 months now and so far it is the best point & shoot camera I have owned and I have owned several
The plastic feel is a nice strong plastic so it keeps the feeling of it being novelty while feeling of good quality
Interchangeable lens can be a game-changer for someone interested in raising their photographic capabilities and the NEX mount lens catalog is fairly large
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
its definitely not the best I've experienced
The camera comes with everything you need to get started, and includes a very helpful handbook with illustrations and all you need to know about this product
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
The 10mp camera is great but don't expect much in low lighting
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy
It's light but it's solid with a nice rest for my thumb
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
OK
The video focus will hunt a TINY bit when zooming, but, this camera WILL zoom during video, unlike others
It looks like one, but has no mirror
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
Love it
The price was much lower than the retail stores
Read the manual, you'll learn a bit about the options (still have to figure what the 16 panel speed shot mode is about)
I am looking for a compact digital camera for a long time
OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light
I plan on taking it on vacation so I will run it through the gauntlet then
Amazing Camera
For the price, you can't beat it
it uses ZINK system different polaroid
got this as it flew off the shelves.
If you're looking for a mid priced p&s; with great image quality then I would recommend this camera
I liked the sticker effect of the Polaroid, just wish it was better or a cheaper price
Excellent camera
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
So I think I'll keep it
It has a lot of options for photos
I took picture 384 then tried to turn the camera off
Battery has lasted well over 200 pics in a variety of conditions (flash/no flash) but i am still ordered a backup for those long days of photographing things and people and stuff
Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
Upon first attempt to import my photos, it failed to install the drivers crucial to allowing ease of access to the camera's files
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
Only problem - wireless syncing with computer and smartphone for remote shooting
electrobrand lies, gives 0 custromer service, they just don't care
Will try another brand next time
I wanted something that I could leave a photo with the folks I took pictures of
I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash
It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter
My wife constantly complains about missing shots because she forgot to switch the camera back to shooting mode
Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
If they worked these problems out, gave it 30 more minutes of life, and gave it an infrared or radio remote, this would be a great camera, sadly though, I can only recommend it as a great starting camera for kids, or as a high resolution backup camera with video capability
This offers two fully automatic modes ("intelligent Auto" and "Superior Auto", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode
the light auto-correction is awesome .
Not able to sit close
A snap on/off cover would be a better option for lens cap
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
Almost Perfect
I don't think another 12" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
An extra memory card allows to take more pictures
The lens wouldn't retract and the power stayed on with a "Lens Error" message on the screen
Images in low light are very difficult to accomplish and the flash doesn't help with the results (muddy, grainy prints
It's a great camera although like many new technologies it does far too many things for my purposes
I gave my daughter this camera for Xmas and we love it
I was not in need of a new point and shoot, but it was on a great deal and I had a gift card to burn up so I took a shot
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
The camera does all I need and wanted

I had to buy an extra memory stick but it's worth it
In stock items shipped free always arrive in less than 5 days but since this one did not ship I may not see it until next week
My only grip is that taking panoramic shots requires software to piece the images together later (image names for panoramic shots get names )
However, it was not so in my case.
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
The Sony Alpha 3000 is a hybrid camera that combines the internals and lens mount of its NEX line with the look and feel of a DSLR
I was replacing my Canon SD1000, which I loved
can use hot shoe6
Yes, it's huge
The only slight compromise is that the video steady shot feature is not quite as good as you would find on a high end consumer video camera
In the photo, you can actually see the oven and refrigerator and even read the clock on the oven and microwave
Unsatified with picture quailty
What the heck - can anyone give me some help here??I left on a trip after only having the camera for a week and hadn't really road tested it
I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice
Feels like a much lighter version of my alpha 65
Also The White balance was horrible
My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
The color is slight-moderately better & resolution much better/clearer than Sony Cyber-shot
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
0 MEGAMIXEL Cybershot DSC-H55
I bought 3 of these for my kids
I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
Thanks
It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon
When in manual focus mode, the viewfinder digitally zooms in to make it easier to find focus
The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
Great
APS-C chip, interchangeable lenses, hot shoe, 1/250th sync for flash, decent AF speed and accuracy in good light
The zoom is nice
picture this :
I bought this camera to use for my wedding
the pictures are small but cute
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
Bottom line is that this camera takes exceptional pictures, but as far as its overall performance, it is trying to fill a very awkward nitch in my mind
I have had a few Canon point and shoots that still operate fine and have never given me any problem
It is sleek & easy to use
I think it's a great camera for someone who knows the basic of a camera
Nice
The fast shooting takes some getting used to
Great camera for a great price
Excellent Product from SONY at an unbelievable Price
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
I t has the perfect size and all the functions for a family camera, and in a affordable price
basically everything about it
Get Camera even comes with a rechargeable battery which is semi charged
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
Remember to buy a memory card too
I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments
picture clear
The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use
The results are exceptional, the videos are super clear and the audio is great
Way faster than either of my Panasonic Lumix cameras
Great camera, until it stopped working
There are so many features, it can be difficult to figure out the one you want to use on the fly
Pictures with flash are especially poor
Sometimes it is slow to focus in real dark scenes
It is very small and portable, you can bring this camera anywhere you go
Easy to use  Small to carry on everywhere
If you want a bridge between a digital 35mm and the little point and shoot or cell phone cameras this Canon SX700 should be considered
I like the Powerful 30x Optical Zoom in this camera
No high-speed-shutter scene mode
great camera
I did not like this camera very much
While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
And the HD video (720p) is very good for a camera of this size
Got this for my wife
Better than their previous version
Great camera, upgraded from my Nikon Coolpix S8100 when it crapped out
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
10X zoom is wonderful
The a3000 (also a5000) are probably just what the serious but cheap amateur needs - a second body
Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments
I love it, LOVE IT
Overall, though, has the best pictures so far in a compact camera with good zoom as of May 2014
So I decided to upgrade, not to a professional camera, but to a better one
Easily fits in pants pocket
Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
Nice
Once unplugged the camera would shut off and not turn on
This Nikon Coolpix L830 takes four AA batteries so it is a bit of a battery hog but, I feel the batteries last longer
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
Auto scene mode doesn't pick the right scene indoors in low light (wants to use night landscape), use Regular Auto in that situation
After reading several reviews that talked about poor image quality, especially low light images, I was hesitant to buy
Recently swapped my much heavier Nikon D90 for the much lighter Sony A3000, since owning this new camera my interest in photography has gone through the roof
the moveable lcd screen is great .
It grabs a quick picture when we need it
i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
First off, I am very happy with my purchase
However, if the shallow grip doesn't bother you and you want the newer kit lens plus the touch screen, by all means, get the Rebel SL1
Happy with photos -- noted bright, deep colors
The T5 has a much more comfortable grip and feels more solid in the hand
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
Just get out there and take pictures
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
The size is tiny, which I love.
There is a T5 and a T5i and it's not easy to tell what the differences are
This camera is extremely user-friendly, the battery life is great, and the photo quality, pretty darn good
The viewfinder picture is a bit less clear than I would like and somewhat small but manageable
I am also pleased by the controls, grip, and video quality
The zoom is seamless and it focuses faster and clearer throughout the entire range than many SLR lenses I've used
We purchased it at our local retailer and had a good experience with it
Give the gift of instant pictures to your family and friends right on the spot
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
00 off, if purchased with this camera
It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
the red is gorgeous, which is a plus, a deep shimmery black cherry sort of color
Also seems to have issues focusing sometimes at the end of the zoom
-Battery life: I wouldn't call it miserable like other reviewers, but it doesn't last a long day; I suggest you to buy a spare
It was worth every penny
3- Battery is charged through USB cable and if you get spare battery it requires swapping back and forth (Battery life is not good either)I am thinking of returning this camera eventhough I like Coolpix over Sony or Cannon but I think there are set backs on this one
Yes, it is still relatively small compared to other cameras, but I guess I'm just used to my old Nikon camera that could be easily accessible at moments notice
Zoom is awesome
The app then connects to the phone and applies the tag based on date/time
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
My eyes are over 40 years old (the rest of me feels 29) so I have some trouble seeing up close
Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
Unfortunately I ended up sending it back
doesnt show pic right when printed
It is very plasitc-y and feels as if it will break easily
And has more than enough settings to capture the image in many differnt lights and you can edit on the camera
However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement
The shots out of this rival in color and sharpness that of my DSLR (when the dslr is shooting in
The video itself is quite amazing
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
Camera doesn't have a view finder but it makes up with tilt swivel screen in many direction so you can take pictures pointing above your head (if you're in crowd or if bright Sun is blaring in the middle of the day then you can Change screen position up, down or in sides
I like the ability of just buying AA batteries and not being tied down to a lithium battery pack
It takes excellent photos, easy to use, great zoom, and fast
Don't forget that, for those that complain about the quality from Any camera, it's a no-brainer
I will never buy another brand again
and you have to connect it to the camera to charge battery, not take battery out
At first, I was concerned that this little camera would be what I was looking for to use
It's fun just to take to a party to record for memories and to actually print out the picture in front on your friends/ family will blow their mind
Makes the foray from automatic cameras and point & shoots almost effortless
This is a great little point and shoot camera
I would recommend this product to the  non-professional who simply wants great pictures and video
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use
While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options
Great quality
What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
The video also has more artifacts than the NEX or alpha cameras
Keep the camera
They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing
No manual controls: I didn't buy this for the manual controls (its a point & shoot remember, get your Binford 5000 25pound mucho $$$ rig out for the tricky stuff), I just want to whip it out,  take pictures and video, and it does that well
However, if you're looking for the best camera to take to a concert for example, this is it
Great Camera
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
So happy with the low light pictures too
Excellent
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
ONE FABULOUS PHOTO TAKER
Great camera
I like the RED body although it shows fingerprints more than a black camera
Nikon L830 Great Camera
I used it (for 1st time) at my son's college graduation with excellent results
Five Stars
I t has the perfect size and
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting)
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
I&#8217;m not sure Sony&#8217;s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently
Plus video is beautiful
In Arizona, I took lots of photos at an outdoor Chihuly exhibit in the Arizona Botanical Garden, both in the afternoon and early evening light
It's really fun to take pictures with
My more mechanical wife managed to get it closed and I left with the camera
This camera is highly recommended
Expected better from a $500 unit.
It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera
Zoom is great, but be advised camera shake is multiplied when you have it on maximum zoom, so if you plan on taking lots of long distance shots I would invest in a tripod or monopod
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
I wanted a fast point-n-shoot camera
However, not perfect, and it could be substantially improved
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
In many instances just to make simple exposure tweaks you have to go several levels deep in the menu system
Again, it exists as a second camera
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
Canon -- by far the best camera made at all levels
for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with
Absolutely
the quality is superb .
lens changable
If you're going to stare at a camera's LCD screen all day maybe this isn't the camera for you but if you want GREAT IMAGES then definitely buy this camera
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
However, I do have a few things to complain about...
- BATTERY LIFE: It's relatively, well, miserable
They are selling this camera at such a lower price only because they want their customers to invest in their great lenses later
Positives:
She loves it - compact, clear pictures, very convenient, easy to store in pocket or purse
Being a mirrorless DSLR, this camera does not have an optical viewfinder, which has it's upsides
Love this camera
I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4
Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks
Bought this for a conference event
Best camera I've ever owned
I give this 4 stars because it is a bit bulky, the materials feel pretty cheap and it feels a bit like a toy camera
The battery life is good too
For the past week, I've been reading the manual from cover to cover both learning what this camera can do along with deciphering all the technical lingo
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
(almost)
A Great Camera
Just What We Wanted
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
Its very bulky, which i guess isnt to bad because it does print pictures instantly
I ordered this camera and accessories on the 1st and chose the free shipping because the camera was shown as "in stock" at Amazon
I think I'll stick to Canon's from now on (my two Canon SLRs (film and digital)still work beautifully)
The zoom is also fantastic - image stabilization works well with this, unlike the Lumix, supposedly the best rated in this category, but in my try-out, irregular at best
For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition
I have had no problems with that at all
As a realtor I was having trouble getting good photos of small rooms and this camera has made things those photos much easier to take
Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top
The 20X zoom on the SX280 was good, the 30X on the SX700 is even better and gives me better photos of distant objects
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
10x zoom is great for shooting the types of photo's I need to shoot
You dont have the convenience of a &#34;pocket&#34; point and shoot, but the picture quality is a lot better than the Canon pocket camera I had
The manual is excellent.
The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37
This camera doesnt zoom but I was able to transfer my SD card from another camera into this one and it printed the zoomed in photos
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
Have a great and easy to use bundled software
Blah camera
Find it expensive for what it is
Problems solved
Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
On the other hand, the resolution of both the viewfinder and the rear screen are rather low
Flash location is a bit off, but I'll get used to holding it a little closer to the edges
Nikon S8100
Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact
3rd Canon SX series with lens or lens cover hang ups
A horse and buggy it's not
Great pics
What a great little camera
Nikon Coolpix S8100
We used it for my Mom's Christmas card photo and they turned out really nice
As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it
Takes some really killer macro photos and zoomed photos and thus far I am impressed
No ink, digital images better than expected, decent low lighting shots
It fits comfortably in my hands, and it's easy to use
Love It
Image quality is very good
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
Easy to use and color image is fantastic
I spent a month looking at cameras, Nikon, Canon, Samsung and more, but after reading all the reviews and being completely confused, selected the L830 and am happy I did
Sure you have to keep super steady but i find that to be a huge advantage over the L820 which had not so great low light pics and suffered from blurriness
There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration
The photo quality is amazing.
Well wait no more!
The flash quality is such that I am not going to complain about where it's located
The pictures come out a bit fuzzy and the focus is how steady your hands are
First, i realized that your finger gets in the way when you hold the camera, so your flash wont pop up
Side by side comparisons with lesser cameras bring out the start difference in color clarity and definition
I can see the screen fine, but I can also see that the camera is not being held rock steady
I wish I could give this product five stars
Quick time between photos, surprisingly quick flash cycling even
This takes amazing quality photos on auto mode, has lots of settings
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
camera readily available from local pawn shop?Unlike 30 year old Kodak, this Nikon junk probably leaks oil, but sensor is so tiny, hardly any oil lands in the sensor area
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
Don't zoom to the full length and don't use C-AF
Sharp results against complex landscapes
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
Worth every penny
Just shoot and click
I bought it as a gift and I almost swapped it with my Olympus when I saw the great pictures that it produced
This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
The video's turned out good also
I like the fact that it's a 30x zoom-yet is pocket-sized
Extremely clear and realistic
Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line
2 at the widest end)  and shooting without any flash
Soooo tired was I of the washed out deer-in-the-headlights effect of the Canon - finally, I take a picture of my dog, and it looks like my dog, you know? It seems a small thing, but hard to find at this price
I did extensive research before buying - I had never had anything but a Canon in the point-and-shoot category before
The video that can be taken with this camera is amazingly good, as well as the still photos
Dropping cameras is bad
the grain was terrible .
No Wi-Fi
I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap
I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
More than I expected for a SLR cheap camera
They also have the ability to take video
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
Poor Quality Control, Lousy Customer Service
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
Love the Nikon Coolpix S8100
I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed
I guess if wifi doesn't matter to you then this is your camera
&#8230;
stop deliberating and select it
I have only had it a couple days but I love it
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera
Thank you to Amazon for undoing my mistake
The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
Oh well
I'm a non-auto pretty much manual kind a photographer and don't like all the special things this kind of camera does
Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive
After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised
WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet
I did notice there doesn't seem to be an HDMI port, but honestly I never use those anyways on any of the cameras I do have one on
People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion
This camera is a bit bulkier than the average compact camera, but worth the size due to all the features
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
This one fits the bill beautifully
Focus is fast and accurate
I highly recommend this product for the price
THis camera is significantly more weight in the hand
I took about 1200 photos on that trip without a hitch
Defective video recording: uses too much battery
You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality
There are plenty of adjustments to get great pictures and I guess if you want more adjustments then maybe you should think about a DSLR
did not give it 5 stars because it does not include case
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400
What I especially liked:-The picture quality in general-The 30X zoom has surprisingly low chromatic aberration
It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
This camera is truely superb.
The panorama assist is great and provides a better scene than the sweep panoramas I tested
&#8230;
Photos are also beautiful
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
However, I may have to buy another camera anyway as my friend doesn't want to part with the S8100
But over all I give this a definite 9/10
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
3)to take low light pictures without flash I have had to use the continuous feature rather that the low light or party setting which both use flash
It didn't have white balance meter, but still much more versatile than this thing
) Combined with the fact that one has to constantly switch between LCD and viewfinder by pressing a button, the low quality of the LCD and the viewfinder (the latter being horrible) makes taking pics with this camera a frustrating experience
I think it will give me some great close up actions shots this summer on the lake
and I'd be tempted to pay that much
Love it
The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built
I am just glad I can have a compact camera that takes next to SLR pictures
Great camera
So Fun
Still learning
The only way to see your movie in High definition is to burn it into a Blueray DVD (expensive option)
Killer Camera with Amazing Battery Life
Love the simplicity, the 34x zoom, the easy picture modes and manual setttings, the video, the sound
inconsistent quality
The camera is light and has a great sensor, but it's a pain to shoot
The other 2 things that I'm not happy with, is the charging system and no manual mode
I like to buy a less expensive camera in case I drop it in a lake or off a bridge by accident, and this seems fine for the price
Like other recent cams, there's face-tracking to try to get snapshots "right" on the first try
I really loved the camera
The pictures it takes are beautiful
Lens is capable enough too
The quality of the pictures are great
-Powers up and is ready to shoot at the blink of an eye
It records great videos with stereo sound
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
Two of us had these little wonders
Not only will the price be better, but you might find the earlier model still has all the features you want
This little camera worked great
it takes 4 regular 2AA batteries, which I like, as its quick and convenient, and I was able to pop in my old SD card and get to work taking photos
If you're on a budget and want to get an interchangeable lens camera without necessarily going full DSLR, this nicely fits in your niche
Because of my incredible busy lifestyle, I have not used it a tremendous amount of time
$400 bucks for 3 months of use is sad
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
Big 3
Controls are easy and intuitive
The flash really drains the battery life quickly
highly recommended
Since it is just past the one year warranty, it too is junk
It's very easy to use and looks great
Great in low light
So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding
Nikon Coolpix L830 - Great Camera for the Price
It didn't hurt anything, and left the protective film on the screen,quite invisible
love this camera
Remarkable closeups
5- Excelent software package.
I have few digital cameras, but this one is the best ever
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
The zoom is great, the pictures are awesome
The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
I've been using this camera for a few months now.
I concur with the majority of the pros I've seen in other reviews, but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers:- TOKEN GRIP: While I'm sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors, it's still hardly a grip
However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
A Beginners Dream Camera
BEFORE I removed the protective film on the screen, I used some Xylol with a Q tip to rub the lettering off, and left the film on
Performance is exceptional compared to my earlier point-and-shoot (although the sensor size is identical), daylight pics are great, and the low-light problems that I was experiencing with the older S230 have disappeared
So i decided to give it a try and buy this one, since 20
5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later
Gives instant photo reference to add to journals for art, travel,  and scrapbooking
Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
The issue is with the audio
Best camera I have owned in a decade
Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken
I love this camera
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
I added a couple of photos of my cat and golden retriever taken in the continuous mode (12MP*)
Which is a result of the CMOS sensor it has which is also why it is good in low light conditions
5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies
It took a little playing to get it to connect with my iPad the first time, but wow, what a nice feature
the glue simply didnt hold
i use this as a second camera
Very handy when you just want to take a quick video without having to switch modes on the camera
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
easy to use
I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
Caveats / Downsides: (These are all relatively minor complaints, not deal-breakers, although they're all things that are annoyances that I notice on a regular basis
Sony products are the best of the best
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
The LCD screen is horrible quality as well
I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
2- Lighting is not automatically set and after you take the picture you will find out if the brightness needs to be adjusted
If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
Cheap, light, good sensor, but that's about it
I would like to say a little more about the image stabilization
And it's less than $60 with two extra batteries
Not having a view finder sucks, but I shoot with a nice Nikon and that's all I use
Make sure you take the lens cap off before you turn it on
The tech seem surprised when I told her nothing happened
Flash photos tend to have exceptionally poor color, relative to how well the camera does everything else
and I don't miss not having a viewfinder
There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
This is a great value in a little interchangeable lens camera with a traditional style view finder
Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great
In fact, it is the biggest reason behind the selection
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
Great compromise
I wanted a camera I could be comfortable with, not spend too much time setting up my shots, and still get a great picture in the end
I love this camera
LCD screen is beautiful and high resolution
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
If you are shooting a lot of video with a DSLR, you'll probably want the T5i
It i truly an excellent camera with very powerful features and almost all DSLR type capabilities which you will need to capture the special moments in your daily life
No suggestions for improvement
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 is an okay little camera
The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
Very satisfied with the camera and the transaction with Amazon
The internal memory seems to be defective which makes it go wacky
Sony A3000 Super Value
Incredible value
just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done
totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
I too would have to agree it is annoying and I often forget to move my fingers as I am not quite used to its location
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
The LCD has painfully low resolution
Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
Its two items; a camera and printer compressed into one
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
you need good lighting in the room or outside in order to have a half decent picture
So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken
Very happy with this purchase, especially for $200
Two cameras ago I had a Nikon coolpix that was a very good camera (this was about 6-7 years ago)
Too early to fully rate this camera yet but a little dissatisfied
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
Tried the "Trouble Shooting" suggestions
Hope the zoom is good
Zoom Framing Assist - very useful new feature to compose your pictures at long telephoto
It did produce good quality photos
Great Point and Shoot
Love this product
She points and shoots and it is perfect, from outdoor action shots to indoor birthday parties in low light
To add insult to injury the software the camera comes with does not offer that either
The instructions that come with it are very basic
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
The camera body is solid/well constructed, grip is ok, a bit stingy on the left side (but I have small hands so not a deal breaker), & yes, the dial is stiff but doable
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
SMILE
Excellent camera
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
Some nice features, nice to be able to print pictures
So please, read the specs on this because I can't explain what they mean anyway
I wrote another review and this is the update.
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
The mode dial is well thought out; the auto scene select mode is dynamite
you will be very pleased with the images
I have noticed fewer problems after shooting with the camera for several days, but remain leery
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
The huge viewscreen tilts and swivels to make it easy to take a pic of something low to the ground (resulting in lots of right up in their faces cat pictures) and its big and bright
Picture quality is unbelievable
I haven't done many people shots with flash yet , so I cannot comment of reports of the flash washing out subjects
Come to think of it, all photo software from camera manufacturers is lousy
I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
The image quality is amazing, and more importantly the focus time is much quicker than most cameras in this category
Great Camera For the Money
In other words, the photos are great for a sub-$100 camera, as long as all of your photos are taken in the landscape (horizontal) orientation
I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
I put a 128MB CF card in it.
I wish the quality was better
A new high-resolution 922K, 3" display
I tested it by taking a flash-free picture of my kitchen at night with all of the lights in the house off
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
At first it looks and feels a bit like the first round of digital point and shoot cameras
I like the ease of selecting the shooting mode, switching between the various menus, and the playback mode is similar to my old Canon
This is only the first day of using the sx700 but it's performance has been impressive
Great Alternative To My DSLR
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
This camera is the best I've ever owned
The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
I read this camera's review and I though it was a no-brainer
What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take
Can't download photos into android tablet
Not sure this is the camera for me,
It has a slight darkness to it but it has an option to brighten your picture however, the image looks distorted
I've tried put jpg images taken by an iphone into the SD card, but it can not read the pictures and shows "file error"
Mine came with all these plug adapters for different countries, which may be useful for those that travel, but I just stored them in the junk drawer
I haven't tried video yet
I like the fact that I can just plug the camera into the charger instead of removing the battery all the time
CAREFUL
Meaning it can stand up better to heavier lenses
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
Great camera that takes great pictures
Uploading them to the computer is a breeze too
Definitely a good investment.
I wound up with a Sony
One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24" long
Took 45 minutes of video and camera was still going strong
So nice and compact
This is not a SLR camera
When you have a really nice camera, I think you inherently want to learn more about the art of photography and I've signed
The Sony a3000 takes clear, noise free photos even in low light and crisp, bright video
I love everything about this camera, quick and easy instructions for the &#34;how to's&#34; no film came with it, but I ordered it on amazon prime and it was delivered in 2 days
I totally love the screen versatility
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
I can't wait to use this on our Alaska trip, the reason I sprung for a new camera this year
First, let me say that I am not terribly techy
It's a brilliant camera, and if you see one available but it
Not bad for instant crafting
Throw away the magnetic case
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
Holiday Gift
User manual is not printed, it is on a cd which is a bit of an inconvenience but saves trees :)
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
At times its a bit bright (so you really have to play with settings)
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
on a HD memory card, because a regular memory card was not capable of filming it
However, it has a few minor downsides which are minor, but regular annoyances
I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
Again, I don't mind relying on auto and scene modes on a point and shoot but those modes have to do at least a decent job of interpreting the scene
It feels very sturdy in my hand
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
Spend three times the price and maybe it might be better
A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
The zoom is spectacular
My wife enjoys taking videos when we travel
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
Really great little camera
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
I did a lot of research before I bought it
it is a little bit heavier and bigger than what I had expected a mirrorless camera would be, but still way lighter and smaller than a regular DSLR
(maybe in a few years?)So, I wanted a camera that could deal with low light, shoot fast, start up fast, shoot again fast, and be around 200 bucks
I'm keeping it since it serves the purpose and I figured if I really want a good quality print, I can just print it from the store
It's very awkward and I always worry about people touching it when I'm passing the camera around
I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
When I looked at the image on m computer screen, I can actually see the pixel noises
The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
I would have given it 5 stars except for pictures taken of small children or animals
The form factor is nice, great for keeping the camera steady on the go
It can easily handle a 16 GB memory card, and it also automatically connects to the computer for uploading pictures
The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
I haven't figured out how to take good action photos though
You cant even film at night time
I started using it straight out of the box without having to read a book of instructions
great tool
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
But this is not much of a factor unless really zoomed
I'd say that this camera is perfect.
The macro shots are great
Have been using it for wildlife and birds recently and the zoom makes for some great photos
Second, it doesn't come with a separate battery charger, so, if you have a spare battery, you have to use the camera to charge it, which is not as convenient
I am on the fence about the settings buttons and not having a rotating selector switch
The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
Very easy to use, features are intuitive, menus are simple but give you a lot of options if you want to get creative
I'm better off taking pictures with my regular camera and making wallet prints at Costco
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
First of all, the plastic this camera made from feels so cheap
I've resorted to keeping a rubberband around the body to keep it from opening
It felt a little like finding the needle in the haystack
I've been using the predecessors to this camera (the 260SX - 280SX) and this has one of the biggest bumps in performance and quality
you're not going to find a better camera for this price
I haven't dropped or mistreated the cameras, as far as I know
There are still some features I have to use
For the features, this camera is hard to beat, the automatic scenes do what they are supposed to quick, and easy
I've never used a View FInder so I don't miss that
takes good pictures for what i needed it for
Usually I wait for the reviews and buy then but the features on this looked good and besides, its Christmas
Don't expect it to be more than that
Great compact and effective
(2) holding the camera still enough for low light photos at long telephoto settings was a problem
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
I really liked it and was finally getting into to the point where I could switch back and forth between settings, and could anticipate what setting I'd need for the best picture
Not really great
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
Besides that
I love the camera.
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
-I can control all the options i need to as a rookie
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
My friend bought a cheaper one and the photo prints are significantly better and without streaks
some of the great gains over g2 --
I ultimately returned it
In looking at the specs on the L830, it looked like just the right thing to replace the P100
I have had the camera just over the 30 day guarantee with Amazon and the lens stopped functioning
(Darn
Will be shipping it out tomorrow and will update for your information when I have the refund in place
Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are
I then bought a Panasonic that I used a lot and really liked but after 4 years I thought I could get a better camera
Articulating screens are not necessary for me and I'm not overly impressed with touch screens
This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options
It doesn't even give you a numerical percentage anywhere
Great quality and the pictures are clear and it has a fast shutter speed to catch  my 18mo old son
But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
- lag or hesitation where I try to take a picture quickly but it won't focus and therefore won't take the picture (usually after I just turned it on but sometimes randomly)
Best camera I've ever had
This is a beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
I am very please with my purchase of the Nikon COOLPIX L830
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
-Comes with some rad software to help with editing
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
An A++!!!
Great buy
It is definitely better than other high-end cameras that I have owned
I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels
I've only found online stores that sell it
Bottom line is I AM VERY HAPPY with this camera
I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera
It takes excellent point & shoot pictures just using all the defaults (it seems to be smarter than I am)
Photos taken in dim lighting requiring an ISO setting of 800 (or higher) are not very good
Minor cosmetic flaw that does not affect the performance of this great digi cam
My husband thought I was getting way to much confidence in the zoom, but my pictures turned out great especially for a point and shoot
My daughters and their friends liked the photos with colorful borders
Would highly recommend getting one
great camera
as of now I'll never go back
Features = zero and the biggest issue I have with it is that it is incredibly latent
7) There is no battery bar on the screen nor in the menu, I've yet to see it after using this cam many times
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR
Awesome pictures
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
I actually find it annoying, but got used to it quickly (now I just don't spin it all)
Convenient case by the way
The panorama modes are wonderful.
Its the best camera for the money and it takes beautiful pictures
Exactly what we were looking for in a reasonably priced high quality compact camera
This camera worked great on my recent trip to the Butchart gardens in Victoria
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
2 thumbs up
The image quality is superb
We were looking for a really good pics with a great auto mode and we narrowed our choices to the Nikon 8100, Sony HX5V, ZS5 and Canon SX210is
Meh
With a 2 year old, I want to capture as much as possible without having to worry about bulk and lenses
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills
I put it on par even with the Canon T5i
When I opened the box I was initially shocked by how small the camera was
3 OSS Lens for $427
Pictures come out so clean and clear even in the dark lighting (zero light) at night
I used this for my trip to Spain and Italy
Flying bird photos just did not work well at all
i've tried the polaroid 300 and didn't care for it either
that meant even less light and just as much action .
Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like
The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers
 I went out and got the Canon today.
stop deliberating and select it
It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body
So far, so good
It is small, lightweight and very easy to handle with one hand
This has become my go-to for quick pictures, even though I have some more capable cameras available
Maybe
It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
You won't regret buying this C=
Beware of SD card compatibility
With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
Great camera for on the go people
I bought this camera at the end of August.
It's not entirely on par with a proper DSLR, but they're getting there
I have had it less than a year though and the battery is shot
The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price
What I was not crazy about:-The GPS tagging is mostly a gimmick; it actually depends on an app on your phone, which records GPS position and date/time
Recylce time for most modes is a bit slow, but if you leave your camera on continuous mode, you can get that second shot off almost instantly, provided you don't need the flash
It was terrible
My daughter requested this product last year for x mas but unfortunately I could not find it
In terms of video quality I can confirm what another reviewer referred to as &#34;fixed patter noise&#34; to be an issue
8) As for "plenty of options", a cheap FUJI cam had more options than this thing
Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
positives
now what about the flash problem ?
my pda becames a digital album .
i give it 10 stars !
) when shooting special projects, but often don't want to take all that gear along when I travel
Great point-and-shoot with simple to use options
I am not even an avid photo-bug
Very thin and light
For my company I was the designated photographer for one of our events and they wanted me to use this particular one so that customers can also get a copy
However the size camera alone makes it very much an outlier and for travelers of those who appreciate a more svelte form factor there are better options
However, issues (for me):- this camera is much bulkier than my Canon
I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
-Sam
Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
The biggest problem with the video is that you can hear the noise of the zoom when you zoom in & out during video shooting
However, it is bigger than i expected, and I don't know if I'm a fan of the entire blue color on the pictures I print
I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a very solid point and shoot camera
I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
Image quality is top notch for a point and shoot
It's a little larger than most models but it still is carried in my front jean pocket at all times
the A37 operates the same way
Once in a while I'll get a winner but more often than not, they look washed out
When using zoom it doesn't take clear pics right off
Don't use alkaline batteries
If you are shopping for a DSLR camera, be aware -- this is not the one
Highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants a little extra with their camera
Again I only used it for 3 days, so perhaps these features were overlooked, but at the least I can say that finding them was unintuitive for me
We have ordered 3 of these camera's
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
Pictures come out vertu nice and crisp
I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels
This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
I often find that my fingers confuse the issue without my intention or permission
My daughter Loves taking pictures with this camera
For example the Panasonic GF3 is often on sale, and in particular with the fantastic 14MM or 20MM pancake lens would give better image quality
I've never owned a compact camera anywhere near as fantastic as this camera
I like that it automatically goes to or from facial reconition to macro, etc
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
The quality and build of the camera is okay at best
Takes great pictures
I was going to buy a Nikon s820
This is really not enough for me
Bulky & poor quality prints
Steady hand needed
You just need to hold it differently than other cameras for the flash to pop up on the top left side, one handed pics (for right handers), no problem
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
Great Camera
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
i agree with the positive reviews .
Good value
Or if you are on vacation and wish to use it every day, just prepare ahead of time by buying a spare battery and make sure both are charged every night so that you have fresh fully-charged batteries come morning
The lens has a great range to it, the wide angle is indispensable
start up is so quick ñ
Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
i use this as a second camera
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
No can do with this camera
Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
For my long overseas travel, the GPS function is actually essential
it 's a winner .
A sign of a good camera is its capability to take pictures in the dark
Nikon will not cover under warranty, wants $100 to repair a $200 camera, that's approx 4 months old
The pictures certainly told a more vivid story
Highly recommend
The students LOVE watching their photos print out
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
I stepped outside and just snapped about 4-5 photos before coming in and downloading
I needed a good camera to take photos of prom and other activities that my daughter has and this camera was truly great for that purpose
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality
The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations
It's not working for me at all when I got the camera it was a picture on it I think someone returned it I need a full refund I can't even contact the seller
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
I'm still getting to know how it works, so it'll be awhile before I become a novice
Takes beautiful pictures
Happy wife,happy life
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys
NOW THIS CAMERA  IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES AND MOVIES ALSO WONDERFUL
Tempermental camera
Crossing my fingers the lens doesnt start acting up, i will update my review if anything goes wrong
If you want a very light camera, with more battery life and to save some money, the T5 is excellent
We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
The Olympus had nice features (8x optical zoom, manual capabilities and threaded lens barrel)
Pictures and video look very good, better than my other cameras
The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
This is the best entry level APS-C camera you can buy at this price
I am in love with my camera
All in all it does allow low light photos
Don't waste your money
However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion
A buying tip: If you are attracted to the latest, greatest model in a line of cameras but it's beyond the budget or has more features than you know you need, check out earlier versions of that model
That camera is a horsew and buggy compared this one
These photos demonstrate shots from very slow motion up to very fast motion
The new sensor is unbelievable
i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
My friend enjoys the shake reduction which saves her quite a few pictures
I bought this camera as a replacement for my wife's Kodak Easy Share
For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
Easy to use, fun to explore the settings, takes amazing photos, and it was a GREAT price
I can throw this in my backpack and take it anywhere
Was just out in Colorado for 2 weeks and took lots of pictures
I would like to see future models have WIFI and viewer for your eye
Uses a rechargeable battery with a tiny life :(
At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there
After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
The printing does work, but as others have mentioned, the printing function kills the battery
It's basic design and straight-forward operation make it a great choice for students or someone who wants something that can give them better image quality than their phone or point and shoot
However, with the SX700 there is no choice, you must use the screen
Very intuitive, great functionality and better yet great quality pictures
Quick to turn on and take a picture or just a moment pause before starting video capture
Though the internal memory did allow me to take 22 pictures and a 15 second video before running out of space, so there's plenty of room to try it out before investing in a memory card
If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
Buy some extra batteries
Bought it for my daughter's graduation; she loves it
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
I love that the camera has a digital screen on the back not like the old polaroid cameras where you have to peek through a hole to see what you are photographing
I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
I expected not much but the digital files are of acceptable quality
Does not have hdmi output
I went out and bought a SanDisk card and the camera finally accepted it without error
Now for the not so good part
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
Bottom line, this camera captures the image I want captured; every time, in stunning quality
This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
I bought this camera for my gf since she always wanted one that has the ability to print pictures - but after using it on several occasions I wish I got one that you have to wait for the picture to show up on the paper
12-1-10:  The S8001 has a defect in the firmware
The macro took great pictures of flowers and the detail was awesome
9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
Viewfinder image very crisp
5fps) and doesn't stop until you release the button
And the zoom is incredible
Awesome little camera that takes great pics
I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those
The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
You get a beautiful pan shot
I've taken this camera on two trips- one to Arizona, and one to France
Not bad at all
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
So when we got the camera, it had been opened, photos taken on it (digital ones) and you could clearly tell that the quality control  by the third party and amazon is not there
I have just started using it and so far, it is very user friendly
I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
If I had known more about photography and could have set if for manual settings, I might have done some better, but overall quality of the pictures was amazing
that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos
This is the workhorse of a point and shoot camera
Nothing protects the lens, so I would suggest getting the case
I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
Super pictures and nice feature set all at a reasonable price
Downloads easily to iMac
Truly happy with my camera
As to the dreaded lens error message, you must get into the habit of removing the lens cover before turning the camera on
I think that for the price and the quality of the pictures, this camera is one I would certainly recommend
The instructions are 3 pages and do not explain the menu functions
The S8100 does most everything else very well though
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
That makes taking pictures much more efficient
Enough said
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
The pictures are crisp
This is a great camera
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
Easy to use
Fantastic clarity and detail (even when I zoom in on my computer)
It's perfect for this use
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
overall it is the best camera on the market .
Which I guess is OK because they turn out bad anyway ;-)Finally
It takes great night pictures and video, still checking all the extras out
I probably bought the first Sony digital camera that recorded on floppy discs for $500 in 1997
Great purchase
if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner
The only complain I have is that the camera is not suitable for fast moving objects like sports
If it cant focus it flashes a red parentheses around the subject and doesnt shoot
In love
Quality is a bit poor
11) Garbage autofocus in video mode, I think pressing the take a photo button brings it in to focus though, sorry I forgot the name of that thing, strange, I know
The pictures come out remarkable
We just had a baby and wanted a good camera to capture memories, and we made the right choice
We took this great little camera on a trip to Mexico not long ago and it was awesome
Solid build like a mini-SLR
 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
Very handy if you like how a picture turned out and want to try to repeat the results
I know Nikon has a reputation for doing better in low light; I found that wasn't the case unless I used the night setting or museum (too slow for children)
Colors were all off
If it washes out, Move Back,and Zoom In a little to Compensate
I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance
Great camera for the price
I also TOTALLY RECOMMEND getting the battery grip:Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release for Canon Rebel T2i, T3i, T4I, T5i,Digital SLR Cameras with 2 Extra LP-E8 Extended Life High Capacity Batteries, Wireless Infrared Remote and Lens Cleaning KitThey add so much to this camera as far as feel
This camera has survived 6 months in the harsh desert environment of Afghanistan, even survived getting blown up without any problems
I also find using AA batteries easier and less expensive than proprietary batteries
We've had this for almost a year now and the photo quality has been very good
All in all I am very satisfied
I'm not a professional but it sure feels close to being one for me
DSCX-HX5V - which I LOVE
If I'm shooting RAW, I want RAW only, adding JPGs just reduces available cache and storage and increases write time
After taking a few photos, the mechanism for processing the photos seems to be on the blink and I am getting a white band of mottled colour on the lower half inch of the photo
I rather liked the old lazy way of the auto flash happening when I needed it
After using a Canon for a number of years, I was pushed away from Canon by the fact that their newer cameras have an unusually slow continuous shooting mode
Love the 30X zoom
Download it fast to your computer
Its difficult to navigate through the menus, but everything is basic enough that if you just play with it, you'll figure it out
The images are sharp and the colors are beautiful
It does not provide you that option on the menu and it does not have
still zippo
The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
I was forever hitting the playback button with my thumb, because that is the natural way to grip this camera
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
They absolutely love it
I don't mind the fact that it doesn't have a view finder seeing as I haven't used one in many years
The charger didn't work
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
APS-C chip, interchangeable lenses, hot shoe, 1/250th sync for flash, decent AF speed and accuracy in good light
Finally, the software Nikon supplies is lousy
To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
The flash comes up automatically but needs to be manually pressed down to be closed
I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
It wastes storage space in the SD card
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
They also slowed the zoom speed down (to reduce noise?)
Nikon compact camera
I do not regret my purchase
I have had Canon and Olympus products and they do not even compare
What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
Even with the max zoom the pictures turn out great
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
It is much lighter and smaller than the A37
The menus could be a little more intuitive and a printed manual would have been great (it's on a disk like all other camera's these days)
Pictures come out vertu nice and crisp
I dont mind how the flash needs to pop up, it was an easy adjustment to make
But being well within my price range, I couldn't resist buying it
Its does really well in low light also
My S8100 is being returned to Amazon for a refund as I have to give up on Nikon
Back lit CMOS, where have you been all my life?
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras that you can buy today for under $200 don't allow you to adjust these things but really if you're serious about photography learning how shutter speed and aperture work together to create photographs is very important
You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
On very close up shots, we have experienced almost too much light
I set my Polaroid Z2300 at 8MP and the pictures come out nice, very little gets cropped in the printing process
I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
I'm not asking for metal material at this price but it could at least be made from just better plastic
Lots of cool settings, far zoom, amazing quality videos and pictures
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
However, the manual says you cannot change the zoom while taking video, so I want to verify that and make sure the focus keeps up
The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
Unfortunately, the unit I received didn't focus consistently at all at the longer focal length
Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
It's not entirely on par with a proper DSLR, but they're getting there
Feature packed lightweight camera
Here's my experience with it for the past year:The bad:-about 1/10 pictures in lower light areas would come out COMPLETELY whitewashed, no matter the setting I used-it was really difficult to focus it on up close things-it took forever to focus-I'm now getting lens error readings (and, like I said, I've had it for only a year)-it randomly deleted my graduation photos
there is zero stability control so you have to have very steady hands
It is also really quick (start up and shutter speed)
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera
She wanted a semi-professional camera for her Christmas Vacation to the Dominican Republic
Wanted RED, who doesn't???  Found it here and love, love, love this camera
makes for a great toy out with friends or parties
The user interface is extremely intuitive and the picture quality is outstanding
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
* Almost the same battery (NB-6LH) as for SX280 (NB-6L) - old one works fine
Third camera for a family member
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
Great buy
Would recommend for beginners or someone who wants good simple shots of their vacation
I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip
These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations
I would like to also have a instant picture camera but after trying out this one, I think I'm done trying to search for another one
I don't mind the cheap plasticy feel of the device nor the rather limited feature set compared to most other point-and-shoot cameras
But because there is no viewfinder, it is difficult to take pictures, as it is very hard to keep it still, especially with the zoom
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
No can do with this camera
It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
When in manual focus mode, the viewfinder digitally zooms in to make it easier to find focus
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
Fairly Ordinary Camera
I read some negative reviews about the service dept
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
It wasn't hard to do, even for a non-techie
for this price that was awesome
The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers
I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319
If you're looking for a good case, the Case Logic QBP-202 is a perfect fit (still allows you to store a small cable and some SD cards if needed)
Battery has good staying power
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
Only problem is the film has to be purchased online
First thing you'll notice - this camera can deal with low-light like no other compact camera
Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line
The buttons are rather stiff.
blurry
its more like printer than polaroid
right?  Also, some may "gently" suggest that I quit whining and splurge on a DSLR or something - and I would agree - but I've seen pictures from a point-n-shoot Canon SX120 of kids in dimly lit rooms and they came out sharp every time
The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
A great upgrade for me, all my family pictures, inside/outside are much better
Notice I said make better photos instead of take better photos that is because by learning how shutter speed and aperture work together you will be able to create photos where regular point-and-shoot cameras would fail
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
Does anyone else have a problem with edges
The camera itself shoots much better pictures than the screen shows and prints are pretty true to color
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
this should give you an idea of the capabilities of the camera
The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera
I am older and cannot use anything complicated and I find that this meets all my needs and is easy to understand
Great product for point and shoot and fun that it prints
I think this was the best idea to come up with this camera along with the lens together as a bundle deal
You would think the batteries weigh the camera down but nope, this camera is small and light
On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
I absolutely LOVE this camera
Makes the foray from automatic cameras and point & shoots almost effortless
Five Stars
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
Love it
I love this camera
In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum
I LOVE the Nikon Coolpix L830
Both issues are easy to deal with once you know they exist
Absolutely PHENOMENAL
Also, you need  a VERY steady hand when shooting
Ok, so you aren't going to get super duper mega fine picture quality, but it isnt bad either
Sometimes if you just point-and-shoot in auto mode, and take a flash photo, the result can be pretty awful
Would not function right out of the box
The NEX 7 is a must have
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
still waiting for coupon for 99% off second one
I chose it because it is a 20 mp digital
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
Nikon S8100, I love it
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
Canon puts in software to make a virtual wi-fi connection with your cell phone so you can move pictures for sharing on social networks
Also, the camera has enough manual settings to get some really nice shots
Fantastic camera
The zoom is great
Writing in continuous mode can be very slow, and you can't shoot again until it's done--the wait is about 12 seconds at the highest resolution
The camera is so smart - is has a "Smile" feature that only when the subjects are smiling will it take
Impressive
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
First of all
To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography
The printer is ok, most of the pictures have little tiny lines over them but they were printed out of the camera so it's ok, I guess
Very good camera
It's all the fun of a polaroid with the benefits of digital
Most of my indoor shots were without flash and came out wonderfully
I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
The interchangeable lenses, compatible with the Nex series, make this truly versatile and a great entry into the prosumer market
I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
I noted that the s830 was better rated on Amazon
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
I am using DSLR but sometimes I really need a small and talented compact camera
This has become my go-to for quick pictures, even though I have some more capable cameras available
However, I really wished I would've done a little more research because I do keep in touch via social media with my family and this would have been a few steps easier to upload pictures had it had built in wifi like the Canon SX510
Other complaints in reviews have to do with the location of the flash - not a problem for me
The photo editing software that is included with it is also outstanding
The only thing I absolutely do not like is the flash
Nikon S8100This camera is a pleasure to review and I can't say enough to describe what a superb instrument it is to use
I have a 5-year-old Canon that cost a third as much as this NIkon, but gives me better photos
This is the lastest purchase for me in the PowerShot line of cameras
Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
Two annoying things though (and I'm sure it was to cut down on cost
Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000
In fact there was a topless sunbather in one that I hadn't seen and my son was delighted that I got such a sharp, focused shot
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has meet all the promises
Result is vibrant picture
Good value and my daughter loves it too
the panorama photos are flawlessly stitched and consistent due in part to the Panorama 5 software that comes with the camera
A little bigger and heavier than I expected
The old POGO film works with this camera and is cheaper than the Z2300 film
Only thing I'm not crazy about is having to replace batteries
Not at all worth $200
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera
I only have one minor complaint
First Rule in a Gun Fight, Have One
First Rule taking photos With A Camera, Have One
Top notch
I was not disappointed
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
This camera is awesome and deserves a 5+ star rating
high quality camera
Poor design decisions (probably some poor marketing influence, too):1
(I have owned many canons and a panasonic lumix
I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
Awesome
It is extremely enjoyable to take pictures with this even for a novice like me
I was greeted by a persistent and distracting screen flicker that I have not seen in any other camera
This camera is great for a novice like myself
Nice photos
After owning Canons and Nikons I tried this one because of the 30 X ZOOM and am VERY PLEASED
It is easy to focus and just point and shoot
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
Love this little camera
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
Now this is a camera
Photos taken in daylight or bright indoor lighting display vibrant color and are very sharp
Sharper pictures.
It has been all that I read about and I am very satisfied with my selection
There is a lot of value in the features
Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around
The picture quality is amazing
Great Compact Camera
) is that you can choose which images you print out which means that you save paper and have better memories
Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
I was buying a camera solely for still photography, and, if that's what you are looking for, there is no better in this price class
Very good image quality/Good feature set for the price
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
The photos are crystal clear and true to color
I did buy it before all the cameras went on sale for Christmas, and i was bummed i didnt wait
Insert sd card and choose the prints you want to print
This is stupidly under priced
The camera has a solid feel to it
Fairly good camera for the price
great camera .
I narrowed the choices between the following; Olympus VR2, Sony''', Samsung""", Nikon S8100, Cannon'''
It's easy to make the photos
I look for it in Amazon marketplace and the Nikon S8100 is it
All in all, no complaints
While reviewing the camera prior to purchase, I noted other people mentioned the placement of the flash
THe clarity of it is wonderful and it is extremely easy  to use
Great camera
The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen
The photo here definitely doesn't do it justice
This camera is amazing
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
Don't have to do any image editing straight out of the cameraImages are sharpLighting is accurate, and the camera resolves high contrast very well in dummy mode (ie Full Auto)It has a Viewfinder

My experience is you get the best results in sunny weather and indoor with flash
I got a lens error and the lens would not retract
Thus, the one star as there isn't a zero star rating
Volume could be loader, so you can hear the stereo sound better
Unacceptable Reliability
Smart Camera
The picture quality is sharp and crisp and my friends think it's the coolest thing ever since sliced bread
Easily fits into my waterproof case for taking out kayaking
There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
anybody can explain that ?
3 OSS Lens for $200
I do really love this camera
I love this camera.
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this camera
I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
After my grand daughter dropped and broke the lens and telescope, I put it away and just used my phone for the past year
Five Stars
Im not an experienced photographer but even on auto its amazing
Not much of a learning curve at all for me, because I had a different Coolpix prior to this so it's similar
The quality of the pictures isn't perfect, but they are good enough
This camera is awesome
Feels like a much lighter version of my alpha 65
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
Polaroids itself are affordable because they are built to be a bit less sturdy than a regular camera
This is very cumbersome
Would be nice to have a better LCD)No thumb wheel
Only complaint is the weird little flash that pops up under your fingers, but that's not a big deal once it's open
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable
Good items
Nikon Coolpix S8100 Don't lend it out
Light, very light
The only good thing about the flash is that it cycles very quickly
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
I love the great, awesome 3 inch 921,000 dot high resolution screen
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation
First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it
Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive

The interchangeable lenses, compatible with the Nex series, make this truly versatile and a great entry into the prosumer market
I haven't taken a bad picture with it yet
Perfect camera with a 10X zoom
Bulky, ok camera
The image stabilization is excellent
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect
So simple and we got fantastic pictures in San Diego
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
I also liked the zoom lens - it works well
Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings
HD video is captured in the
A great camera
It's a must have for our 10 top essentials for throwing amazing outdoor parties
The camera is a great size and fits in her purse/pocket
I have already received it and, so  far, I am getting great results for both purposes, familiy and work
(1) my eyesight makes it difficult to manage
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
the g3 looks like a work of art !
I get a lot of complements on this camera and questions of "where can I get one?" and it got only a tiny chip when it fell four feet onto concrete
That's like all my other cameras EVER, and its a 10x zoom, not 3x or 4x) So, video  works  good when you compare zoom distance to light collection
Currently it seems to be available at some pretty attractive pricing, which would seem to support my impression that it doesn't have a very well defined target audience
The camera has very good image stabilization which is essential for shooting at slower shutter speeds especially at longer telephoto settings
The best camera I ever own
Very disappointing, not what I was used to from Amazon
I can't say enough about this camera
It went right back
I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
what task do they perform ?
My fiancee and I were very happy about buying this camera after doing our research
The LCD is great, but annoying as all heck in bright conditions
Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera
We were not disappointed at all
I know I've still yet to explore everything my Sony has to offer but I'm so proud to share the pix I've been taking with it pretty much right out of the box
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
The LCD screen is tough to use for manual focus and you cannot see anything sharply through the QVGA Tru-Finder - viewfinder at all, no matter how you adjust the dial
I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
The Nikon Coolpix S8000 we have is a bit limited for that use
One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is "A3000", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number "ILCE-3000')
 am so glad I bought this camera.
I am very happy with most aspects of the camera although I haven't had time to thoroughly evaluate it
I was able to use it to capture my 2 year old son opening Christmas presents, and almost NONE of the photos are blurry, despite the fact that he was moving constantly
A great value, I have had 3 other point and shot cameras( 2 Fuji,1 cannon) this one is the best
The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR
No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment
For fun only and not for good quality print
I have no regrets with this purchase
My reservations-  Hate not having a viewfinder
2) the controls are NOT intuitive and are semi difficult to useI bought this camera in December 2010 and if I had to decide again, I would have / should have bought the more intuitive Cannon
I've really enjoyed it
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
Not nearly as good as the original camera, even though it is digital technology
no biggies
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features
great camera
Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
absolutely breathtaking .
This is a replacement from the P O S that was a Nikon
Pretty cool camera although the quality of photos are pretty messy
1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
It is not by any means for serious photographers or anyone that wants to take a family portrait
It's just an amazing deal to get so much
Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
My only disappointment is that it takes more time to focus when using the zoom than I would have thought
I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4
Im not an experienced photographer but even on auto its amazing
very cheaply made .
i cancelled the order .
And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two
It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around
How can something that cost almost 200$ have the quality of a 20$ camera? The pictures print blue
I had purchased the sx280 for a family member to use on a trip to Europe
Would buy again
Got it for about $200, and I won't stay awake at night about it being in the car
The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
(I could not compose properly in bright sunlight using the Nex 3)
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
It even exposes the flash correctly
mts HD format
Great birthday present
It's a good camera for amatures
The flash works beautifully, the red eye feature is good, the pictures are very sharp and clear
I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR
So, why the strong rating for a point and shoot Nikon?1
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
Some photos do not show up because they are too high resolution (12MP is where I maxed out
i took this on a cruise and caught pic's of flying fish between the waves
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
The user interface is extremely intuitive and the picture quality is outstanding
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
Great for zoom
I sold my Canon A640 and replaced it with this and I am very pleased with the sharpness of the photos
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark
She is very familiar with various cameras since she has been very much into photography for the last 15 years
Fast to set up
It's easy to use and gives you little tips about different tools
I was very pleased with the results
Great bag with the all-important AW cover
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
A steady hand is required at all times or forget it
8 II Camera LensThe best part about this amazing lens is that it's less than $100
Granted, i am currently deployed in Afghanistan where dust is always a problem
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
Looking at pictures taken with a Canon T3, and this, there is no comparison
A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
Makes very good pictures
this camera has a major design flaw .
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
I'm not going to bore you with repeating statistics and features many contributors do
Easy to use
Also I noticed no zoom motor noise while watching the video
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
I spent a considerable amount of time looking for a camera that I needed for a special use
All in all I am delighted with this camera
You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
card reader is included .
its the best ever
got way too many blurry pictures .
Disappointed
I don't know why the nav keys can both spin and be pressed
The Sony a3000 takes clear, noise free photos even in low light and crisp, bright video
Better on sale
You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto
However, I was unhappy with pictures taken in low-light
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
Picture quality on auto and scene was marginal
It takes fantastic indoor pics
This is a great camera for the nostalgic types out there that like the esthetics of the vintage feel of the modern spin on the old Polaroid cameras
Taking the battery out as to try reset it didn't work
took pictures of granddaughters prom in front of window no back lighting
Those are my three main reasons why these canon cameras are the BEST for new photographers and even videographers nowadays
Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing
I have used cannon and kodak and I have to say this camera is by far the easiest to use
The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing
One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
This camera has new technology for its "night portrait" mode
My prints came out streaked
This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera
If you don't do video AT ALL, the T3 is cheaper still, and has more battery life and is an ounce lighter
I went to New Mexico for New Year's
Other things:(a) contrary to the good impression many reviewers have of the Sony 18-55, I found the lens to severely lack in sharpness, especially at the borders;(b) the sensor is very nice, but a bit noisier than my 16mp Pentax K-30;(c) the camera comes with a small brochure, but you'll have to download the more comprehensive handbook from Sony's website;(d) no charger, either--you can charge the camera directly or buy a charger;(e) I found the menu fairly difficult to navigate
5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera
There is also Av mode where the camera allows you to adjust the aperture of the lens while it handles the shutter speed
The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
It has a lengthy instruction book and will take time to master its various intricacies
The form factor is nice, great for keeping the camera steady on the go
I love how easily I can switch from stills to movie mode
The screen would show the error code "this card write protected"
what's not to like?First, here's what I've learned since acquiring this camera: even though it can accommodate interchangeable lenses and has an apparently conventional viewfinder, it is NOT a DSLR
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
Even at 120x, I see very little grain and surprisingly little chromatic distortion
I've come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist
ConclusionThis is a low cost camera that takes great pictures
Easy to use
At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4
Nikon Coolpix S8100 is totally cool
Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind
Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds
Could use stronger zoom
This is an awesome camera for the money
Since I do a lot of work on photoshop, I really appreciate the large resolution that the images come in (5152x3864)
0 port and it cannot send data at it's full capacity, and says this for every USB port on my tower
I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice
This camera shipped really quickly and will be a really cool gift
Having said that, it by no means feels rugged
Having a nice case is key too
It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light
(5) Continuous shooting mode, while very fast, only supports 5 photos at once
I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
I FOUND IT
Easy to use
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
Softer than the F3Previously in Auto mode, the Nex won't allow you to change shooting mode via the custom buttons; you have to go through the menu system
It has been all that I read about and I am very satisfied with my selection
We had a photo guest book so people could take their own pictures and put them in our book
This camera is in every way awesome
It's a nice camera
thank you
Bought this camera as a refurbished item at a really good price
I love the movie feature too
It also doesn't automatically reposition pics taken in portrait mode (you'll need to put the camera upright to review)
Real Disappointment
The only fuzzy images I have gotten were from testing the continuous shooting mode, and once I learned how to use the mode correctly I got great images with it
400$? Really? Sony is surely losing money on this camera
It all depends what you're looking for, of course, but if you want something that takes very, very good pictures but for whatever reason you can't handle the weight and size of the DLSR, this camera is an excellent compromise
Zoom works great, and pics are clear and vivid
Now that I am home, the photo quality seems to be pretty good - at least much better than anything you can get with the cell phone
It does however tell you when you should pop the flash up
It is a little bit challenging to take a photo when focusing on something far away, but it is a matte of getting developing a technique
Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
My dad has the previous gen
this is my first digital camera .
The photos print with a green/blue hue
If you take a number of photos even in moderately quick succession, and then close the camera, you often have to wait several seconds, which is a bit annoying
Fool proof.
I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
I do not like the LCD screen either
Also, so far I have found it to be quite fast with little shutter lag and good in low light situations
I love this camera
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
It also rendered the camera entirely useless due to the inability to even sort through the functions of the camera to try and format the memory card while inserted in camera
The menu system is laughably archaic but, it does the job
I don't use WiFi or smartphone functions
I had high hopes for this camera as a simple one for my wife to use
It's a great step up from you basic point and shoot and from the L820 that we had purchased earlier
I have this T5 but it stays in bag when doing shots
It bounced around in my bag, got knocked off the table a time or two, and overall wasn't treated as well as it should have been
I do like having the saturation button at my fintertips though so maybe i'm really not on the fence
(7) Quick startup time
)Of course I love the 1080 video shooting, but it eats up alot of memory, so you will need a SDHC card or two
On my old Fujifilm S700, the flash auto popped up when needed
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever
Nikon COOLPIX L830
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera; it is very easy to handle and simple to use
Love this little camera
Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing
If you do a lot of video, the T5i would be better
Movies, panoramic shots, close-ups and portraits are all wonderful
or a T mount adapter
In the meantime, I've missed having the camera for my family vacation - ugh
Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
(3) Flash performance is relatively poor, especially in contrast to everything else about this camera
Its the best camera for the money and it takes beautiful pictures
I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my husband, meant to be a replacement for a 5 year old Canon Powershot
The camera operates very easy, if you have used a digital camera in the past this should be no different
More detail. More natural color.
I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
&#34;  The photos, although exactly as described, are really, really small
This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do
Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough
for that price this camera its awesomethe quality  of  the picture is pretty good you take a very cool picture in the night with out flashyou can install external flash and lens on the camera its lightcharging its little tricky but you can buy external battery charger to charge the batter quickly
Basic features are intuitive and easily within reach
This one I could zoom right up to her face and it was crystal clear
Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC
i bought the fujifilm instax mini 7s for a third of the price and i'm much happier
The video resolution on the T5 is better than the T3 and there is an auto-contrast detection
It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
Once on the proper setting it does take a great photo but I'm not sure I want to be so committed to the thing as to have to take a college level course to learn how to use it
It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack
Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top
Currently, it can't be beat
Flash is good and fairly powerful for a small unit, exposure mostly about right
Great little camera
It takes great pictures and is simple to use
It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack
] An example of it at its best is the Oregon Coast pictures at [
This camera is harder to hold still for a quick shot than my little sony
I love using the L830 its easy and I enjoy using the built in effects
In previous cameras I have owned the battery has lasted much longer
as it was such a great concept
Every time I review the pictures from this great little camera, I am always amazed at how good this inexpensive point and shoot is
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
The thing that drives me crazy is that i can't contact the seller so i can request return
Would recommend this camera
It comes out darker and blurrier
The paper prints so well that it looks old-fashioned still
I got the "Battery Exhausted" message with the batteries it came with so in my excitement, I ran to Target to buy 2 packs of Energizer Lithium batteries, a case and a memory card
The various levels of megapixel quality is great
For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen
Image quality is very good
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
Sometimes when you edit out noise, information is lost, and when I really zoom in on the photos produced at low ISO's, I think some sharpness has often been lost, and I wish the camera would leave these photos grainier, as it's always possible to edit them (sometimes better than the camera could itself) after the fact, but it's not possible to get back what's lost
I was looking to replace my aging Kodak and decided on this camera after months of searching and reading online reviews
I'm not a professional photographer, nor do I spend hours on my computer editing photos & video
Will keep working with it but don't think this should have to happen
If i want manual control, it's there
Great camera
Nice pics, weak lens cover
The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
This camera is great, easy to use, you can take pictures and also HD Video, which is just amazing
My Canon has spoiled me because that battery lasts forever
Does well in good light situations
The photo quality is excellent
The things that jumped out at me most:+Excellent image quality from a proper sensor, little noise at 1600 ISO or lower
The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
Absolutely LOVE this camera
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
If you buy this from a reputable brick and mortar camera dealer, they might actually let you immediately trade in the 18-55 and put it towards a nicer lens
If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate
Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
Not What I Expected
This camera is a must-have for long-distance zoom power, ease of use, and quality of pictures
Outstanding Camera With Numerous Small Downsides
It takes a little more time but that's fine with me
If I'm shooting RAW, I want RAW only, adding JPGs just reduces available cache and storage and increases write time
EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway
It takes great shots and the flexible viewfinder display is great for taking picture's in a crowd
I wish I had researched a bit more to get the latest, but I had to have a replacement camera quickly
The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
ConclusionThis is a low cost camera that takes great pictures
I suspect I was swayed by the positive reviews I read
Im still researching a way to print items that were not generated by the camera, but this thing would be that much more valuable if it could be 'just' a printer
Bought this camera about a month ago
but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots
I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
price7
I have found that the video is really great compared to an older video camera I had
I love this little camera
Best camera ever
It has great value
00 total
Plus the extra battery life is so useful
it's a great camera
my wife loves her camera - the pictures are of high quality and it was easy to use
My wife loves the camera
Even when I kept the ISO from climbing above 200 and held the camera reasonably steady, low-light pics were usually fairly grainy and/or blurred somewhat due to motion
Note: when you first look at the digital display of a picture, you might question the quality, but when you actually upload it to a computer, the picture quality really cleans up and the pics are great
we purchased this camera when we took a trip to Alaska
So hard to find the perfect camera, but am real happy with this one
I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used
Very easy to use as well
This camera was way too expensive to have such poor quality
This camera is extremely versatile and easy to lug around
Most of them are blurry
While the size made it super portable, I needed something with more zoom capability and a better lens for low light conditions
just point and shoot
read the directions !
i have not got around to reading the instructions, the fine print is hard to see,i have a  best friend that has one so will get him to get me started
A wonderful camera
the movie mode is also working great .
I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed
It has no major flaws and can be counted to operate reliably every time
But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box
Great camera no complaints
Low light video is good but the more you zoom the less light you get (gee
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
The panasonic does not have as long a zoom, but it serves my purpose and cropping  the final picture brings my subjects in beautifully
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and the controls & setup are easy to navigate
I love it
The camera would work with internal memory - but would not work with a memory card of any sort or size installed
love the speed and ease of the features and captures
You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge
But the reliability of this camera SUCKS
If the photos weren't so great, I would have seriously thought about returning it
It's also easy to download photos - software was easy to install and easy to use
I really do like it
Chunky enough to fit in your hands, not small enough and fragile to slip between small cracks and break
I highly recommend this product (my mom and my sister both bought one)
It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance
So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
1 MP sounds fantastic
2) Flash can easily wash out the subject if you are too close
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
I also upped the rgb one notch toward red as well as the vividness it one or two notches depending on lighting
Five Stars
Great point and shoot
I read about it in the NYTimes, which made it sound like manna from heaven
Currently, it can't be beat
this makes a great pocket camera
I definitely recommend it
I had considered a D-SLR, however this camera is all I need, and then some
The macro is so much better than my old camera (a small digital point and shoot, its a trooper, but very basic) I tested it out on some earrings and was able to get very crisp extreme closeups, with little need for editing
I will return to using Canon cameras as they are more durable and of higher quality
Not too hard to steady with image stabilization, but with practice I will get even better
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
Excellent camera
Tremendous camera with terrific price
Low light video also very good, but there is one setting in video the 1080 without the star where the video looks dull
5 stars
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
However, a T2 is a lot cheaper and works better
I have to change one
however, it is an older version
Awesome Camera though
I wasted $74
(And that was the narrowed part)The Olympus had all the right specs
Indoor flash photography
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
I take it with me everywhere,literally,
There is also to many settings and it is difficult to figure out the best one, if I want to try different settings, the subject has moved or the light is different by the time I scroll to the next one, that said, I do like everything so far and will continue to experiment with all the settings
I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
Simply put - the BEST FOR YOUR MONEY
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple point and shoot
I'm taking pictures like a pro these days
But it was quick and easy
Nikon Coolpix L830 Diugital Camera
I miss having a grid,may be
Great camera
Lot of research
I bought  this camera for the convenience of the video, but has been a dissapointment so far, I have sent it twice for repair (for me is a defect of this model, but check it out before you buy)
I use it mostly on Auto and it works extremely well
The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio
Come on Nikon
Taking pictures of stationary targets, the camera handles gracefully down to 1/5th of a second, which I find absolutely remarkable
It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6
Excellent features for low-light photography -- including a double-exposure mode to capture that great sunset with your foreground subjects illuminated with flash
Quality is amazing
We took only 3 shots, and the streaks just got worse
Great for Shots on the Go
It's not the smallest camera in the world so don't expect to go unnoticed if you put it in your pocket
Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
We also took some shots outside after dark and this camera really excels at night
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
The image quality is superb
Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either
Some of the downsides are things that
Great performance in exteriors and landscapes
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
This is a versitle camera and you can adjust the setting to take what ever kind of pictures you want
It is a product that meets specifications if Information
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
All the different features are wonderful
The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses
I wouldn't want anything to happen to this camera
And, with 3 kids - this is important because I waste a lot of shots
and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR
This camera has excelllent battery life
This camera makes it simple
Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great
Except, it should cost about 100 dollars cheaper
Does lots and has great zoom
Bought this camera for my boyfriend and he was so excited when he opened the box but it is true that the battery does not last long and the worst part of it is that the print quality is terrible
my son loves it
Soo basically you are getting an apsc camera body for 200$
Sticky backed photos perfect for scrapping
I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used
Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
I was also able to get wonderful short 30 second videos of the wedding ceremony
- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels
I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera
We ordered this after seeing it featured on a local tv station's &#34;Tech Check
I doubt there is a better camera for the money
First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000
I am an experienced photographer and normally use a full-size DSLR (D300s, D200, etc
Great performance in exteriors and landscapes
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
Now six months later the lens error has happened again
With this camera it is much different, you hit the button once and it shoots 5 incredibly fast frames, then the whole camera locks itself up for 30seconds or so while it tries to process those images
Also, I think this long a telephoto really needs a much improved stabilization system, similar to Panasonic's 5-Axis stabilization
Other reviews suggest thie Nikon Coolpix L830 suffers in build quality well that bug must have been fixed
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
Cons: Action shots are blurry even with stable hands, no view finder
And using the low light setting, such as what you would use with a birthday cake with candles type of picture, works amazingly well
this is somewhat of a neutral thing because some people love them and others hate them
I could not find the special effects for the colors such as grey etc
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
switches are poorly assembled and the chrome ring around the lens feel of prior to use
That's what I wanted and hoped for
Good for a novice photographer
Very nice but with common problem of LED/LCD screens
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
The tilt screen is great, it allows this senior to get shots that would be difficult otherwise
The placement is very awkward
The Price is Right
the screen cracked and couldnt turn it on
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
Bad prints
I love the fact you can tilt the screen
Low light is still a bit of a problem
The Digic 4 processor is a fabulous processor and I loved it in my t3
Not a ground-breaking product, but solid and dependable nonetheless
Fortunately the product works and our niece was okay with it having been opened, however we are sorely disappointed that Amazon lacks quality control even with third party dealers
It actually takes a picture without flash (so as to capture the light behind you) and then takes a flash picture
Yes, it is a fake DSLR
EDIT: 1-13-2011We took our camera to the colts/jets playoff game and got some great video before the game and some great pictures
Still, I'm happy with my purchase and hope to get good use out of the camera
This is the best entry level APS-C camera you can buy at this price
This is a great camera for the price and it take great pictures
Ideal camera for sophisticated shutterbug
The same problem appeared with the replacement after a few months
I like it
I went back to the Cannon SX130IS which is a much better camera
The pictures are sharp, extremely clear
Something I wouldnt have to make an insurance claim on if it were lost or stolen
Dropping your f-stop to 1
I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
Great camera
Great Little Camera
See comment number 4 below
All in all, no complaints
The main operating features are very intuitive
2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot
What really impressed me was the low light performance which is no doubt due the larger ccd
Straight garbage i won't buy another Nikon product any time soon
I can still put the camera in my pocket without too much bulk
If you do not really need all that zoom, the sx280 may be a better way to go
That's a big difference
; love the color
What really impressed me was the low light performance which is no doubt due the larger ccd
Not clear and crisp
If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge
The pictures it takes are beautiful
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
I was meeting up with friends in Guangdong so I had my wife buy another of the same model
This was purchased as a gift
I think Nikon put a really good sensor in this camera, creating a balanced overall package rather than just inflating the megapixel and zoom rating the way some brands do
A little on the small side but the photos are great
For a non-professional it's ideal
Nikon L830 DOES NOT HAVE ANY ZOOM NOISE WHILE FILMING A VIDEO
so you can hear the stereo sound better
the sx280)
If you follow the tips and step-by-step above even if you just use the lens included you will get better at photography
great idea but thats it
The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned
I bought a camera the day i left the States to come out here, and it didnt even last 2 days
I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
crystal clear photos
Nothing looked dark very clear
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
This has caused me to lose some great shots
Otherwise fantastic camera
It prints a photo in less than a minute and the quality is exellent
Anyone can use it
On the other hand, I took a video of approximately 8 minutes in duration with the Vivitar 1700 mAh batteries without seeing a low battery warning, although the camera got pretty hot in the process
just not for me
There are 2 pictures with an Airstream trailer, one at no zoom, the other at 10x zoom
I went at Radio City Music Hall, in NYC, watching Madagascar Live, and I sat in the 3r floor, so far than stage, I put the zoom and I could see the face (all the details in their face) of the people and with my own eyes I couldn`t
if the lense is on or the batteries are low, the camera freezes and you have to turn it off and on
The price was the best I've seen anywhere
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
Better make me happy
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
Another screen difference: the T5i swivel screen is better for video (swings out like a video camera
There was NOTHING at all the least bit loose on my new Nikon Coolpix L830
Sent to Nikon and I'm still waiting after a month in their shop
It cannot overcome dim lighting
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
If you're deciding to buy one of the instant print cameras I recommend you keep looking
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
By far the Nikon Coolpix S8100 is the best compact point and shoot I have ever used
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark
Good price
I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake
It feels good and solid
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
This was a good purchase
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
other times the picture quality is great but that is very minor
It's not a deal breaker and it's not that bad, but just be aware that you can hear the zoom
Seemed like a great deal
again all in-camera
It seems kind of flimsy and probably will not last
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
I liked the idea of a viewdinder and a hotshoe,both of which my nex doesnt have
A really nice feature you don't take into consideration until you're in that predicament
So I am stuck with it now
After a few uses, you'll figure out exactly where you need to place our index finger so it does not infer with the flash
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera that is simple to use
Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face
The L830 can use all three types
In particular in bright sunlight I could not see the picture well enough for precise cpmpositions
I believe that was due to my inexperience with the camera
Here's a tip though
Best compact I have seen on the markte
Never a problem and they all produce excellent pictures
Great instant print/digital camera hybrid
00 total
This is my first Sony I also have a Nikon D5000 but at times you do not need a big camera so the Sony is great
Well, as the title suggests, so far so good
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
This camera fits a unique niche
Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer
Very easy to use
I haven't tried editing videos as yet, so I cannot comment on that, but so far so good
Some more manual control would have been nice.
The Sony menus are a little tricky, but once you have learned how to use, you are good to go
After researching the Sony A3000, I was really shocked to find it at the price I bought it for
I'll start with the strengths
After doing much research I picked this camera to replace my kodak easy share that I got in 2008
great camera , great investment !
If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom
They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
Another law of physics Nikon is unable to overcome, darn those guys again
For one thing, I like having 2 batteries that I can charge and swap
I enjoy using this camera
Poor construction, poor image quality
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
I took over 400 pictures at the wedding and I cannot say enough good things about this camera
I returned mine about 2 days after i got it  it was not worth the money
Good enough for me
In good light, this camera takes very nice pictures
The price seems good at first but you have to pay a thousand dollars to get the zoom that my little sony has
I'm a very occasional photographer, so this camera meets my needs very well
This camera far exceeds my expectations
It is to me misleading for readers to see a 3
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
a friend got this same camera (from Best Buy) and it quit working properly within about a month
I have not been disappointed
I Love My Sony
What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take
On one hand, when my S8100 worked it was a nice camera
I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either
I guess I got a dud but I am majorly disappointed in Nikon
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
-Battery Life lasts me about 2 weeks, and ever patrol i go on i am taking pictures, my job requires it
The VIDEO EDITING  software that comes with it is very good
What a joke
The Sony A3000 is the answer to your dreams if you don't want have the time to learn to shoot a DSLR but want something better than a point and shoot camera
Since I was not going to be using this for videos, I decided to try it
If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder
Pros: Terrific form factor, brilliant LCD screen, 10x optical zoom, usual Nikon quality, support, warranty
COM
It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
bigger image sensor3
This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
I saw my 10-year old bury his head in the manual for a moment or two & proceed to snap off a few zoomed frames overlooking the peninsula
No problems getting started and no problems with the photo software that came with it
Zoom brings the subject right to you
Inexpensive enough to be great gift for young people
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
It  has  a very fast processor,  long optical zoom
So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000
I would give it 5 stars but the flash is right where I would normally put my left hand when holding it so you have to adjust how you hold it so that the flash can pop up
I use this in my classroom
I thought not having the great very wide angle lens and the sweep panorama was ending my photography career
For years I only used my pocket Sony Cyber - shot
My Sony HX1 was much fasterBody is a little too large (but this is a personally preference)Custom buttons have been reduced
It took beautiful photos when I was out west in Wyoming
it is not perfect though .
But I quickly got used to it and trained myself to place my hand elsewhere
What I saw were very clear/crisp photos which appeared to be somewhat on par with my Panasonic FZ70
Excellent camera
Coolpix S8100 camera
It wouldn't be fair of me to leave a "full" product review yet since I'm still learning about some of the features on the camera
This explains why I can say I traveled to at least 15 stores over several months to demonstrate, test and fondle, easily, 50 cameras
I was able to pull it out of the box and start taking pictures right away
I have used many digital cameras.
I need to find some time and just learn how
You will know it is there, but it is not bothersome
According to dpreview
You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it
Once I got it, everything went great for the remainder of the trip
Easy to use
I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection
We were looking at purchasing the S9000 camera, but this one had better reviews and now I know why
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
I have had it about 40 days and am still in love with it
It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses
For this price, I cannot complain
The price is $... more.
A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording, now on the top of the camera
Turn it off.
Service, and quality sucked
With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
2) Much better in low light than a $100 cheaper camera I bought
I now have to go and spend more of my money on a SD card reader so I can easily transfer photos
I began the review at five stars, but dropped it to three because of printing issues
My biggest problem was the printing
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
For under $200, I think it's a great value
Long story short - I am supremely happy that I bought this camera
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
Took it on a trip to Oregon and using it much
I am having fun zooming in on very small images from across the room
It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies
I love this camera it is what I expected  other cameras you get it is never what you expect that you get
hard to go wrong with this machine
Image quality over the large zoom range is a huge plus for this product, even in low light conditions
Lens quality is amazing with a 10x (300m) zoom and a nice wide angle 30m minimum focal length
From reading the other reviews, I'm thinking either I'm doing something wrong or mine is defective
Oh, of note, the 'so called' manual settings on this camera are very poor
PROTECT YOUR CAMERA
Overall I liked it and wished that it would have worked out
Love it, great camera, lots of my friends and colleagues are impressed by it
Easy to use, great pictures
The majority of my pictures are nature - birds, flowers, scenery
I'm a Cannon man back in the day but Nikon has won me over
This camera is working like a charm
the only annoyance is if you happen to turn the camera with the lens cap on, it displays a message and won't go away, even after removing the cap
The 10x zoom is more then enough, I mainly use this camera to take everyday family pictures so the zoom does not get used much
Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
highly recommended .
Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting
It is perfect for what I need
I thought this camera was very well priced also
it was a great deal
Pros: Prints great pictures with stylish borders
big mistake .
If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it
I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice
My smartphone might do better in low light
If you really want a good price camera go for at least a EOS Rebel T5i
The size of the camera is perfect.
The softness of the kit lens is quite evident when paired with the T5
Overall, it is a fairly good camera for the price
One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
You should pay attention to the term &#34;MIRRORLESS&#34; in its description
Image quality is superb and one will love it
Great camera for a great price
Very very nice pics, the "auto modes" work great
A great buy
Don't know why, set it on the star 1080(default) and leave it
The location makes for awkward shooting (its right where everyone would hold the camera)
The image quality is just ok as a point and shoot and the real fun of the camera is the printer
This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly
Very reasonably priced
Five Stars
So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system
But believe me, it's well worth it.
She had to end the last days of her vacation taking pictures with lenses shadowing in the pictures
Coolpix L830 camera
I'm not asking for professional quality here, but it should at least be as good as my iPhone, if not better
So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes
Researched cameras before deciding to buy this one, and expected a lot
It is really nice and pretty compact for the amount of zoom it offers
Use it in anything but good light and things go downhill with the overly aggressive noise reduction
Other wise this is an amazing camera
The viewfinder remains the same
Takes great pictures
Help
Replacing a four year old Canon
very excited
Very disappointing
I looked into getting it repaired in China but the prices approached those of a new  camera and the expert shops said they couldn't get the part since it was made for the American market
2)User friendly memory
Awesome Camera
If there is a lot of ambient noise, and you're careful about this, you won't notice
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
The zoom feature works great, the macro mode is great, the low light function works great (you probably will need the flash only in a dark room)
for this price that was awesome
broke after 2 months
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
Great Camera
I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
I've got a couple of digital cameras.
Favorable reviews insist on the excellent price of this camera
Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
works great- but low memory/battery
It is very easy to use and has a good zoom on it
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
Tough to beat
Although the model is considerably big, I have used original Polaroid models and I love this one so much better
What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight
I will be trying a FujiFilm FinePix T550 next, which sells for the same price but has a 12x zoom, and (I expect) better image stabilization
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port
Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
They won't last
How is it possible to build such a technological masterpiece and sell it for such a low price
so I passed on it
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
It is a little bulkier than most of the compact cameras but the added features make this very compelling
Flash coverage was good for portrait situations
Looking forward to micro photos and other features
takes good pictures
Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
it is basically a nex in a slr body
My A650 takes better pictures a significant percentage of the time and will continue to be in my camera bag until it eventually gives up the ghost
SOLD
price7
Five Stars
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
The internal memory is descent with about 50 pictures worth of space
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
It is much lighter and smaller than the A37
It does operate in low light, produces pictures with great fidelity
The scene settings are very thorough - you can choose between night time / day time / sports and many more
Others are good
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
it is a very amazing product .
But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature
The second one I received was also defective, however since it was pass the original 14 day return policy, there was nothing I could do about it
Flash is not this camera's strong suit in any case
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
I wouldnot suggest the Nikon Coolpix L830 for guys with massive or even large hands since everything is tightly packed onto the camera
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
It is digital but also can switch to the view finder with ease and takes great pictures
I am just a disabled dude who is fascinated with the art of taking pictures that appeal to me
Great Features but flash pictures are HORRIBLE
Not very good
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
You will find a lot of my S8100 pictures at [
One point shy for not having rechargeable battery which isn't all that bad if you're traveling all you need is pop old ones amd replace a sinch
The picture quality is the best I have seen in any camera I have ever used
In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera
The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing
I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend on our anniversary
With regard to the camera,its a complete disappointment
It doesn't provide as detailed a view as some of the higher resolution screens on the T5i and 70d but it is equally viewable in direct sunlight
I can still continue video but am not sure how long I have
This is a great camera for the price and it take great pictures
The EVF is full of noise and is tough to see when you are in focus, but the focus peaking feature really helps me judge when I'm sharp
HD makes it a step above many others along with facial recognition and low light/nighttime controls
I was extremely excited and looking forward to this feature only to find out it was completely useless
Only flaw is that I tend to hold the camera with my left fingers on the top of the case, but that prevents the flash from popping up
upgraded from an PowerShot SX260
This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality
I am not the world's best photographer and I wasted many an instant camera in high school due to my lack of skills
Not a professional photographer and wanted something easy to use and this fit the bill
way cool
This camera is AMAZING, my friends have other kind of cameras and all of them said that my camera is amazing and has a great quality
Print outs do not come out clear
I now have two of these A3000's
Nice
You can also take pictures during videoing
I was not able to get the pictures uploaded to my computer the process was very difficult
1) It is perhaps too small.
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
Excellent
Wrong, except that my problems are different.
You can learn how to work with the flash but it takes adjustment and fidgeting and you can't just expect to take good flash photos out of the box
It's really high rez
a few things that might make it even better :
It didn't miss a beat or even get a scratch
This was annoying
Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer
Really like the different ways it can be used
Reasonably good coverage, though direct flash is never flattering for anything other than fill-flash
So detailed as you review your work, I can even see how good my pictures are without having to use my laptop
And, if you don't want the flash on (I avoid using it on this camera), holding your finger over the flash means you'll never be surprised by the flash going off unintentionally
definetely a great camera .
So we bought the s830
We enjoy the 8100, we had an 8000 and it was great also
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
best camera in its class by far
You can have it up, running and zoomed in all the way in just about a second
great idea but thats it
When it figures out the range the parentheses turns green
I decided to spend the money for a good one and this seems to be it
The resolution of the close-ups is fantastic and the zoom, non-flash shots are also fabulous
Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7
I'm really enjoying having a camera so small and lightweight
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
a little pricy for being such an outdated version of a camera
The bad:Viewfinder is smallLCD is not that sharp and does not swivel (I use it to compose not review my pics, so does not affect me
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
I am not a photo genius, but i definitley have learned a lot more since i recieved it 2 months ago
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
So much better than my other cameras
Be aware it does NOT come with a removeable memory card
The zoom is incredible, crisp clear images
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
However the size camera alone makes it very much an outlier and for travelers of those who appreciate a more svelte form factor there are better options
Outdoor/well lit pictures look good
This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do
The camera is fine, but I ordered the wrong thing
I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be
and the pictures are really very small
The photos it takes are of stunning quality
To start off I wish I was able to give it 4
It's been a great purchase
+Good weight and balance, feels sturdy, unlike the Sony fixed-lens cameras I've tested recently+Quiet operation+Good Battery Life+Proper manual and priority modes-Underwhelming viewfinder and LCD panel on the back-Slow and sometimes flakey autofocus when not in broad daylight-Forcing JPG to save with RAW
Fantastic so far
We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
with fabulous features
Five Stars
I wish I could have gotten both at the same time
Other than that, I'm very happy with it
It's a great size and it prints perfect Polaroid pictures
You can blow up your pictures on the screen much larger
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
I got it now though
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
good product
Awesome camara, and looks cute too
*******As an update nine months later
Opening it is not too difficult, but the closing mechanism is a little awkward
Easy to use, great pictures
This is really too bad because the camera has so many great features and works for 95% of the photos I want to take
So why would you choose the T5 over the SL1? It really all comes down to the handling
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
It is compact and lightweight which makes a great take on trips
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
Don't care how good the pictures are when you use the camera in the sun
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus
It doesn't explain the different modes at all, and gives no tips on getting good shots
The zoom is wonderful
5 x 11, and the printed pictures came out extremely clear
Awesome lay out of buttons: record for video is a hard button that can be used in any mode
Hey Guys, The thing has a MOTOR that works the zoom
I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
The battery has great endurance
It would be nice if the camera had a good battery that was rechargeable
The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested
30x Optical Zoom Works Great, the best compact camera with zoom
It does have good battery life, as I was not able to deplete the battery on a 3-day trip with probably 100+ photos taken
Nikon S8100
for the money this is a deal
For me it was not worthwhile due to two simple factors
I liked it because I was able to make more than one copy, edit it as well as change the setting
A great point and shoot
The camera itself is about as good as my cell phone and the colors look a little off
I cherish all shots in all locations at all times, and the camera's inability to take even relatively-clear pictures has made the camera useless to me
awesome
I can honestly say i am very satisfied with this purchase
Kool Camera
Beware
But I think photographers of all ages and experience levels will enjoy shooting with this camera
1 MP, you can't find it anywhere else
it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
The focal point looks okay but anyone around it who is even moving ever so slightly, will appear blurry
I have had 3 different cameras since the beginning of the digital camera age, and this one is by far the best
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
It feels just wonderful in my hands as the grip is perfect even though my hands are small
I bought this camera last March
We have had very good luck taking indoor pics in an auditorium
At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
My wife likes the point and shoot without thinking part and I feel it has enough shooting modes and settings that I can take professional quality pictures
I love this Polaroid it was everything I wanted
Secondly is the amazing ability to take great low light pictures
My daughter took it on a trip and even tho she left it mostly on auto - the pictures and video were stunning
High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
Since so many of the reviews mention it, I'll start by saying I don't use the video mode, I don't care about the video mode
, so I purchased one anyway even with all the bad luck others have had with this camera
The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
It's a great idea for fun with your kids
If you decide to buy one of these cameras, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
As for the kit, Cameta ripped me off: the little tripod reeks this nasty WD40 smell I've smelt in many cheap electronics which causes headaches and nausea, STRONG nausea, the cheap secondary battery died in days, and they wouldn't give me a return shipping label
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
Had to send it back sadly
This review is based solely on my experience with the camera
I tested this camera on the auto mode and it has totally impressed me
Image quality is very good
Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
Very hard to see the picture in bright sunlight
Other than that, for $160, you get a fully functioning 10 mp camera
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
It's also great for taking flashless pictures inside somewhere like an art gallery
My daughter took it on a trip and even tho she left it mostly on auto - the pictures and video were stunning
Horrible
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price
great
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
The main complaint I have is the picture quality
I would rather buy a nice camera and take the time to have it printed
Once the flash is open, it's easy to remember where not to place your finger and cover the flash
It is light
1 MP and I can say less than $80 for this 20
I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
What a surprise
It's cheap and great for beginning photography
I wanted something to be not to small nor too big, and I think this camera is just what I was looking for
Only draw back is its not water proof so now I have to get another after dropping it in the ocean
this is probably user-idiocy but I cannot figure out how to view/play images without the lens being engaged
- OVERLY AGRESSIVE NOISE REDUCTION: I'd much rather do the retouching on my computer and be selective about how much to apply, and where
Charge lasts a long time
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it
Awesome Price for a Great Camera
8 on the 50mm lens and being able to shoot 1080p video is really incredible
Pros: Battery life seems fair, makes excellent pictures and is very user friendly
and now I'm going to return it
I love it and the fact that the photos have an easy peel back making it fun for collage boards
The lens simply can't get enough light at F6
So far this is worth every penny we spent on it
As with any small camera, holding it without interfering with flash etc
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
Thanks for Canon Camera great and small in size and the most beautiful pictures of the property Send Mobile and zoom Excellent
It takes incredible pictures and the quality is excellent
I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
I had issues with seeing the screen in bright light and it's easier for me the zero in on the subject faster with the viewfinder
OK, so I bought this camera from Amazon, great service from them, only had this camera 2 days so this is just a first impression
The LCD screen is amazing
Love it
I just don't put my finger there - there's no particular reason to do so
Perfect pic
In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
If i want manual control, it's there
I won't waste time with too in depth of a review as there are already plenty of them
It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
10 great price for all the features .
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord
easy to use good price thanx
Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as "ILCE" ( "interchangeable lens digital camera)
Nothing is free these days but this surely comes close
Rebels ROCK: T5 vs T5i
The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise
Great for newbies
Great little camera
In every mode except Manual the settings are easy to find and use
Its a bit large and heavy for a point and shoot, but it still fits my pants pocket
Nice pics
, without going through menu
Everytime you would take pictures of somebody wearing white, there would be a white glow shining in the picture
Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera
Very fast and great zoom
This is a camera for the niche market
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
This camera was purchased  for my  daughter for  fourteenth  birthday
Great that you can pick and choose which pics to print
Great camera
Beautiful image stabilization, especially at 30x without tripod or mono
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
So far I have taken a few hundred photos an I am more than pleased with the results
It's got so many features I haven't tried them all as yet
I had some difficulty with the panoramic pictures
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
I would recommend it
Really great camera
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a simple camera
It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either
It's not suitable for action photography, but for all other kinds of photographic situations, it's certainly up to the task
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
I do like the ability of having a separate button for videos in addition to the normal shutter release
Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
it was a great deal
It's rather a Sony's NEX camera in a SLR body
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality
Time from power-on to first shot is good
Takes good pictures - minor low light issues, but after 10 months the lens cover (plastic pieces slide over lens when closed, supposed to slide away when open), is no longer opening
I highly recommending getting at least one on the Vivitars as a spare if you're planning to be away from your charger with this camera for any length of time
the only thin I wish was different would be a battery pack instead of 4 AA batteries
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
The film has poured out so many times its annoying messy and completely inconvenient
The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
but who cares ?
First Nikon S8100 camera had a defective lens and was replaced by Amazon
When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
Right between the 35mm and the pocket cameras
i am quite happy with the camera .
-Sometimes it takes a while focus when its in AUTO mode (only during lower light conditions)
We were able to take some great shots both near and far
It has an articulating LCD screen and the LCD screen has more pixels I really recommend it over this camera and it's even cheaper
The basic 18-55 lens is great for your daily pictures plus you have the option of getting different purpose lens as well
The fact that is digital makes a lot better then the old polaroids that required film
And the pouch is a great way to protect and carry the camera andfilm film
The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job
And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
is a good article, I arrive on time and in perfect condition, not to be a professional camera takes very good pictures, just make a suggestion, I include an external memory to the article
all metal, but light enough and sized right to slip into a shirt pocket
That makes taking pictures much more efficient
It is a good product and we are enjoying using it
3) High video resolution
Thats a plus in my book
Hi,I am unable to write a review of this camera because I have only received defective cameras
I quite like the product
I do not like the position of the button to video
So depressed but then
In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera
It takes really clear pictures with nice color balance and tones
The wheel at the back is OK, but not as inituitiveFPS is slow
It works great
The picture quality is fantastic
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
You can get great deals on this camera since the 9100 came out which is basically the same camera with more zoom
It seems the past 3-4 years I have always purchased whatever point-and-shoot camera is on sale on Black Friday and I am always displeased with it within several months of usage and then buy another one the next year
What else can I say?
(I could not compose properly in bright sunlight using the Nex 3)
I can't wait to take it off of "Auto" mode and try some of the other settings
I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
Beautiful picture
I am not a great or even good photographer, but part of my job involves taking photos and incorporating them into my journals
There was also noise coming from the camera when in zoom
Purchased camera for Christmas
It would be better have a slower FPS that sits and shoots 1 frame/second (like my old cannon p&s;) but a least you can hold it down for an entire sports sequence and hopefully get some of the action
Comes with a decent kit lens that alone should have cost 200$
In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually
The photos keep turning out blue
I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
Camera for Cabo
so why lie about it ?
(4) Writing images, even with a high speed memory card, is very slow
I think the one most important issue I've noticed is for all its power, the batteries seem to last forever
1 desktop, then copying them to a thumb drive and trying to open the thumb drive in my tablet causes the photo program to instantly crash
Horrible
This camera is terrible under low lighting and is just overall a piece of crap
A great little camera, but I returned for a Panasonic w/ viewfinder
3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
20MP allows me to crop images without losing detailNoise is very well controlledGrip is very good
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
I guess if i bought a camera with a 10 mp, I shouldnt expect much
what's not to like?First, here's what I've learned since acquiring this camera: even though it can accommodate interchangeable lenses and has an apparently conventional viewfinder, it is NOT a DSLR
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
)(1) ISO speed, which I change VERY frequently, requires going into the menu to change
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
AMAZON
A bit bulky with simple menu options
Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
Highly recommend this camera
The auto mode works in most cases
Great camera
bigger image sensor3
I am very pleased with the upgrades from my SX300HS
I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
Takes great pictures
In lower light it was totally useless
Then came the S8100 Nikon ; Built like a brick,
I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
Nikon s8100
It is not as small as my last camera but definitely more compact than my first
I'm struggling with the lever that zooms the lens
In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera
Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera
Otherwise the size, controls and handling of the camera were fine
And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures
Beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
Obviously I received defective equipment
When I hold the camera, my thump seems to always touch that button, will have to work on different thumb placement
Obviously I didn't expect much, but I am very pleased
This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
negatives ?
Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
This camera did not live up to my expectations
The Sony A3000 is the answer to your dreams if you don't want have the time to learn to shoot a DSLR but want something better than a point and shoot camera
) But that benefit is completely eliminated by the fact that the pictures are blurry
You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
It's by no means an SLR with different adjustable lens attachments, so if you're looking for that kind of technicality, this isn't the one you want, but for the price, it's an all-around great camera
Good video too and much moreFor the beginner
The Nikon S8100 should come with a written operator's manual rather than a software C/D that has to be viewed on a computer screen
This is not a SLR camera
It's very easy to use and takes great pictures
In order to store a decent amount of photos on the camera you will need to by a memory card in addition to the camera
Every single thing it does is a mini miracle
Today, I am sending to repair shop - lens will not retract
Another excellent (and cheaper) alternative is the Samsung WB350 (I have reviewed that camera too on Amazon)
Could use stronger zoom
Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera
The main sacrifice in quality is in the LCD and EVF (electronic view finder) which have lower resolutions
It was nice
Terrific little camera
I received this camera as gift in December
The scene settings are very thorough - you can choose between night time / day time / sports and many more
&#34;2, The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is very light
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
Video quality is as good as I have seen for such a small device
It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet
Easy to use Small to carry on
Relatively lightweight, beautiful shutter response, and the test of all tests for images--at full resolution, pristinely clear quality (little noise in the right lighting)
Awesome photos, a couple of reservations
Also took lots of night shots in France, and they were also great
Great in dark places and long distances
The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu
I like everything about this camera except one thing
The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen
I Love My Nikon
This camera takes quality pictures for its price point
The best camera, of course, is the one you have with you
Very happy with my purchase
The Cannon was OK but lacked some of the items of interest
2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
Just what I was looking for
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera
On the other hand I can make it do more complex things
Beyond those few features, I found the camera to be relatively lackluster and uninspiring
It's cheap and great for beginning photography
I thought the unit was a little cheaply made but hope it works well after I get the hang of operating it properly
She took a picture  of a deer in the woods
Nikon does have a newer model out (Coolpix S9100) but I didn't see the point in spending the extra money, especially since the differences between the 2 models are minimal
if anyone has any good ideas for us please let me know
I am NOT a professional protographer
I have 16 months old son who i took the best pictures of him with this incredible camera
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
The face recognition system works really well, how did they get it to do that?5
Compact, great features, and takes very sharp, excellent photos
The mode dial (PASM) is tight requiring an unusual amount of force for this type of dial
Sometimes the camera would be able to show me my existing pictures and other times it would not
bucks in my opinion
But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature
Because the t5 is just a beefed up t3 I can use the same batteries, SD card and battery grip I had for my t3
You can't tell that it takes two pictures because it all only takes the time of a normal flash picture
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
Put the batteries that came with it in, and shot a T ball game, senior pictures for a friend, and went to a local botanical garden since I received it on Thursday, and still has plenty of juice left
Again, the picture quality is fantastic for a compact point & shoot
I really expected this camera to make better pictures
I would recommend this to anyone
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K
I loved the 12x zoom and image stabilization for taking the corners of buildings like the Forbidden Palace
I have lost more than a few shots fumbling to get the darn thing open
For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
WOW! Big difference!
The bad:Viewfinder is smallLCD is not that sharp and does not swivel (I use it to compose not review my pics, so does not affect me
We ordered this as a gift for our son's graduation
There is a small pad for your thumb, but its placement just felt unnatural
-Yes the power on button is small, but i can always get it turned on even when i have tactical gloves on
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise
Results from scene modes may not give the desired results
i love this camera .
i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
Its novelty is great and if all else fails, you got a nice camera for family outings and the likes
It's especially perfect for slipping into my purse to have for any kind of unexpected opportunity to take photos
Loving it so far
They all came out superb
The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to
i do n't think i was asking too much .
So when the S8100 came along I decided to try it and am very glad that I did
Currently it seems to be available at some pretty attractive pricing, which would seem to support my impression that it doesn't have a very well defined target audience
Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes
The camera is not to heavy to carry all day
poor quality
it is basically a nex in a slr body
we were looking forward to many holiday pictures so what a bummer that was
My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
I was looking for a camera a long time ago, but I didn't know wich one to buy
I then realized a major design flaw.
I bought this camera from another retailer because it was available before Amazon
It doesn't respond as quickly as I expected and am missing some good shots
When I share pics with my friends on Facebook they always want to know what kind of camera I used
Since I loved the quality of photos of the S8000, I thought the S8100 might have better quality besides some upgrades tot eh focal plane, better dark performance, etc
So, over all, best compact camera I've seen
Nikon coolpix has some nice desired features and is easy to use
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
If you're looking for a great entry level point and shoot camera with many advanced features then you can't go wrong
I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake
The body is still plastic but the materials are higher end this time around and you actually get a proper textured grip
Design choice of rechargeable battery pack rather than 2 AA lithium ion batteries; pack can not deliver full day of pictures; for whole day, one needs at least one extra battery pack, at $60 each
The only thing is when we ask other people to take pictures of our family for us, the pop up flash can be hard if people don't know about it/aren't used to it
Awesome camera
The menus also offer a great set of tips to help new users understand even the more advanced features
very large pics take 8mb each !
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
The big problem is that the app drains the battery of my Samsung S3 Mini in a few hours
Great camera with excellent features and easy to use
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
Slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor SX280
Bought this as a Christmas present and the recipient didn't like the quality
So I hold the camera in both hands, raise my hands and bend my elbows and look at the screen to line up my shot
the video quality of the camera is excellent, but all of my photos using the flash are overexposed
Sent camera to Nikon, Nikon claims camera is `damaged'(100 images, maybe, max, since holiday
3) Have to change the battery IN the camera
I am satisfied
This is a cool camera
I've posted several photos at this Amazon camera link for people to view that demonstrate the features most important to me
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
Looks like I am standing right next to him
I've only dropped this digital camera once within the year & half I had it & it is still working perfectly like it did day one plus no dings or scratches either
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
I do miss having a panorama option, but I find I tend to do a movie in those cases anyway
When the camera works the pictures are beautiful and the camera is easy to use as well
Canon does a decent job balancing out noise, noise reduction, and detail retention in the JPEGS as you go up the ISO scale
I'll start with what the camera does well: it does fit in the small hip pocket of my backpack, which was a prerequisite as this was to be my camera for long-distance backpacking trips
do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
12 mp pictures will not fill up alot of space compared to 1080 video, so if you don't shoot video, the 4 GB card that came with it should be sufficient
AND it's all in a cute little compact package
Secondly, I had a hard time easily finding some of the settings that I desired
I know this sony wont let me down
Very easy to operate for someone with dexterity issues or large hands
Great pictures and easy to use
Items to consider are: 1) the flash seems to be a problem since I normall locate one finger over the location of the flash
so easy to use, its very comfortable in the hand, it feels quite friendly if that makes any sense :P  The rubbery spots are very convenient for gripping it and taking pictures with one hand
It isnt that loud
It was annoying having to constantly open the flash when I needed it, even in auto mode
My complaints are that the menu system is not very organized, the print quality is not what was expected (based on type of paper too) and there is no way to reverse printing
It is amazing
I intend to carry it in my backpack and play with it some
I recommend this camera for everybody who wants to capture best pictures
The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
Some notes- get the class10 memory card
The built in flash on this camera (like almost all built in flashes) is harsh distributing light unevenly
Amazing quality
20
And now the SX700 with a 30 zoom
I tried to be positive, but
I guess after 65 years of using viewfinder cameras, I just did not adjust to having to look at the monitor
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
You can get crisp, beautiful pictures in low lit restaurants without flash (provided little movements on your subjects part) free hand
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
The zoom is great -- I took pictures of the moon during the blood moon eclipse without using a tripod and loved the pictures I got
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
Blur blur blur blur blur
After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised
Easy use and good pics
Highly recommend this item as a tool or memory captured moment
In Manual mode the few available buttons have to pull double duty and getting everything setup takes some time
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
great portable camera w/ awesome video
I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen
1MP Camera - An excellent choice and the price is quite reasonable
Took wedding Video with ambient lighting colors were vibrant and at 1080PHD
This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen
Wonderful little camera
PROS:1) The Polaroid Z2300 has the throwback design that ultimately made it more portable than the Fuji Instax cameras
this is not a handbag camera .
Great for the price but lacks for video
Thirdly, I didn't like the grip on the camera
Bottom line is you will not be discouraged with this purchase
Overall, very satisfied with this camera, would not have been able to get the awesome pics of the animals without the zoom
The lens gets a little soft in the long end
battery life is ok .
this seemed like a really good compromise .
A super big disappointment
Raw files from this camera provide a lot of flexibility for post processing
, , very cheap
Still trying to figure out some settings, but it's not a disappointment
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
I was looking to replace my old Canon Powershot that's an ultracompact
i bought this last week through amazon .
The zoom capability is amazing
My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
We purchased primarily because we were heading to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks for our honeymoon and wanted something that could zoom (30x) far for those distant shots of potential wildlife
It's not worth 200 bux
The only thing that really stands out about this camera is its size and price point - both of which aren't pros
I didn't want to force it in, so I tried to power down and back up, but nothing I tried fixed the lens error
NIKON COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera
Highly recommended
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
They are not the same, and the T5 is less expensive, though certainly a GREAT "entry level" DSLR
The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3
I'm using a 32Gig Class 10 SanDisk HC Ultra Memory card from Best Buy for $24 and it will allow me to take over 3000 photos
Great Camera at this price point
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
all this cammera can do
The tilt out screen is a nice feature that I did not know I wanted until I had it
Cell phone take better pictures
Excellent camera
Nothing works
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not
Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size
They are crisp and clear, and the color is beautiful
There are a couple of things I did not like
Good color & contrast, even with piles of snow
I wanted to replace my Coolpix P100 that is a GREAT camera
In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
Wonderful camera
On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don&#8217;t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized
Excellent camera
A side note for the camera it does not work with SDXC cards, I tried my 64GB card and it would not register it, but a 16GB card works great
It is so very easy to use and has a lot of awesome features allowing you to take some really nice shots that would normally only be available for a camera that is much more expensive
Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy
The flash is a little overpowering so thought I'd put a screen on it
So, in summary
With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces
I've taken several videos with it and it was simple to do
Menu is not all that intuitive
What is the difference between this expensive Nikon and $5 Kodak digitial
go get it .
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
At the upper end of the zoom range, the focus is a little soft
The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu
I ended up using photoshop and picasa to edit the pictures to try and make it look "professional" something I didnt expect to do by purchasing this camera
I spent a lot of time reviewing compact cameras prior to settling on this one
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
The zoom? WOW I was really impressed
The camera charged and came to life very efficiently
I love it
And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp
I had an earlier version and got familiar with the upgrade immediately
We got the S8100, and she now gets amazing videos, with which we both are pleased
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
I don't feel like dealing with returning the camera and waiting for a replacement, because I just want something I can use now
The things that jumped out at me most:+Excellent image quality from a proper sensor, little noise at 1600 ISO or lower
Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos
She loves it
Excelent price,
Also, the set up for switching between high speed etc is not really intuitive, I'm still working on playing with that
So far after a few months of owning this unit, I have no issues and am having fun with it
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
But, the product was intact, brand new and with all other packaging items
I do not know if this just affects my sample
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
Poor Image Quality and Clunky Design
And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
The low light image quality is far better than all other point n shoot cameras and significantly better than those &#34;fit in the jeans pocket&#34; cameras
Its a cute little camara and I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants that old polaroid feel
The camera is great for what it is
im not a photographer, but i think the pictures come out pretty well
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the film is not readily available
I am done with Nikon products
Attractive and nicely finished, plus the weight and heft in general is perfect for me as it lets me know I have something in my hand that I can control
While this camera is nice and takes decent pictures, I just couldn't deal with the size of it
Comes with a decent kit lens that alone should have cost 200$
And then there's the video
Although small, it is still better than noneIt has a mode dial like a real dSLR
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24" long
Edit- I was told wrong by the Nikon rep
And, I liked the Nikon's tilted screen
I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap
trips .
And it's okay as viewfinders go
I did notice there doesn't seem to be an HDMI port, but honestly I never use those anyways on any of the cameras I do have one on
The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
Works nice and takes video also
Very nice camera
Before this purchase, I was a sony fan, but I am a fan no longer
Overall for it's size though it's tough to beat this
My brother can use my Nikon Coolpix L830 and even likes it but he struggles like a gaint trying to change the a new borns diaper
The dual controls for the telephoto are nicely placed and quite accessible
The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
It's really fun to take pictures with
Same goes for "night landscape" mode
A little on the small side but the photos are great
I bought an external charger with two batteries off EBAY for $10
I had heard good things about Nikons and I made the switch when my wife lost our little Canon point and shoot
It was well worth the purchase
lens changable
Very very nice pics, the &#34;auto modes&#34; work great,
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
Nikon S8100
)The MAIN difference between the two is in the screen resolution: 460,000 dots for the T5 vs 1,040,000 dots in the T5i
Last month my 2 year old t3 stopped working and displayed an error 20 on the screen
New Camera
Great zoom camera
The charger of the battery didn't work, so I need bought a new charger
- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
The wi-fi and app are lame and all but useless
I did actually purchased the camera
Very nice initial impression
I wanted something far more portable that did not require a camera bag when traveling, biking and hiking
Bottom line: Not worth it
I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial
The flash pops up where you put your finger, but you get used to it
Mine is still fine and I've taken thousands of photos and some video
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
It is now April and my camera is already back to Nikon for repair
We went camping this weekend and I took a picture of the moon
I finally ended up returning after I looked a bit online and noticed that this was a common problem
Great Camera for the price
Stored in a padded case.
The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
Highly recommended.
It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
It is so very easy to use and has a lot of awesome features allowing you to take some really nice shots that would normally only be available for a camera that is much more expensive
I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes
I plan on exchanging it
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
Great Point and Shoot
Best of all, the instant camera prints are only 50 cents a piece
After hours of research I had high hopes for this camera
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
It's a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one)
whoa .
No doubt a great value
It takes sharp pictures, is easy to use and lets you via the viewfinder electronically or the LCD
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
I could go on but suffice to say, I was very unhappy
at various events and be able to print them right then & there without any editing
The picture quality is the best I have seen in any camera I have ever used
I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
So all in all I am very pleased
The Quality is Good
I have owned two of these, in black and chrome/platinum colors
For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body
It has great value
The colors are fantastic on the pictures that I print although they are a little bit off they are still very accurate
Compared to a mirrorless camera like the Nex 3 or 5, this camera is superior in nearly every way except the size
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
Four Stars
Will take a shot of one view and convert it into five or six other versions
The loss of one custom button makes this worse
It didn't take long to learn the features and functions
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model
:(I just recently sent it in, after I dropped it and the lens wouldn't retract
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
The picture and sound are so much better
If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
Amazing
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
I don't mind the slighly large size
it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
