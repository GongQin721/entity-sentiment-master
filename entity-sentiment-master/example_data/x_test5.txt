I have been taking a lot of nice pictures and I'm improving every time
It has 10x optical zoom plus around 4x digital
You can not buy this camera thinking your going into a serious camera for any serious needs
I bought this camera to donate for a raffle to raise money for life
The camera is responsive and is able to photograph kids at play w/o trouble
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
The SD card slot is a plus
poor bulid quality
Very easy to use and the preview screen is large
1) for it on their website, but you have to buy a SD card reader/writer and implement the fix with a computer yourself
the battery charger is almost half size of the camera
30X stabilization and pic quality are not perfect but pretty good
I've been a Canon fan for years and we have two others besides this one
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
I have not taken many videos yet, but it looks nice so far
Super handy and great quality
Fantastic Purchase
It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject
The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing
A couple of times I was able to restart it and it would work but now it has died a second time
I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
Canon take note:  I'd love a camera with Less options for those of us who just want to stick mostly to Auto but better low light photos & a panorama option
It is a lot better the the previous camera that I bought and sent back to Amazon
Although it has a lot of neat features, it didn't deliver on true color quality, especially indoors, moving or fairly still pets, or outdoors in my rose garden (which was surprising, since it did much better on closeups of the roses)
It would be quicker to set my preference
I will buy a mirror-less soon, but for the time being this is a great camera
Easy to use
Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
Im very happy with this purchase
She has been enjoying  the functional ease  of it  and the nice pictures  it takes
Not very high quality images
Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400
This one is perfect
Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings
it is going digital but this product can't even provide basic standard quality of digital images
Donation
Figure out if your needs are what this camera can give you, because I am thoroughly happy with mine and will be giving one to my cousin now that the price has gone down
 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera; it is very easy to handle and simple to use
The motor noise is hardly noticable
The "low light" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light
The change to a new box of film did not resolve the issue
The zoom is great, and the auto focus works better than any point and shoot that I've seen
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
I have returned it and am now on the hunt again for a new camera
I've had this camera for three years.
Unfortunately, the flash head can not be turned upward which is a shame
Sample photos will soon be available on our web site: [
After twelve prints, I am not getting true colour
Easy to use and color image is fantastic
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos
One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like
The problem is
The flash is the downside to this camera
The camera did not ship and most of the accessories already have
The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
Great Price
I think the manual features available also make this a real competitor to a small lens, entry level DSLR
Our first good camera
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .
Really great camera
The seller had it to me very quickly and I am extremely satisfied with their packaging and quality of product
I want it to take good pictures for me
If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
Blurry, blurry, blurry
When I called in I was told to take the batteries and sd card out and replace them
This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
(5) This camera takes very, very good photos
The SX700 is a nice, full-featured but not-too-expensive, 2nd camera for this enthusiast
I suggest getting in a store and test it out
Wish it had a view finder, but most point and shoots don't
Although there are some modes I am still trying to get a hang off which come off a bit difficult to use
BadLower light/indoor performance is poor
This whole camera was a mess
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
The owners manual is way too brief and doesn't give enough details on how to use all the features or easy ways to access them
I couldn't see the point in getting another t3 so I read up on Canon's other models
I love the camera
The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony
great very wide and long angle telephoto lens
FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
This resulted in "red" pictures as the shutter fired while the flash, impeded by my finger, only popped up part way and so didn't actually illuminate anything
Will be posting it with a return notification
The biggest problem and most annoying is the door that holds the film in place opens at the slightest touch
Definitely weighs more than my ultracompact, but I knew that going into this class of camera
This picture and video quality are superb
I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
This Nikon s8100 a just a little bigger and heavier (10x Zoom) than the Canon IS1100, 1200, 1300, 1400s (3x Zooms), needs a "slightly" bigger case
It was time to upgrade
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
so buy the g3 .
You do get a few cool options, like color selection when taking photos, and a few frames when you print the pictures
Five Stars
The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
easy navigate menu8
LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
pocket chainsaw
All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
Although not as small as the cameras he is used to, it fits nicely in a pocket
- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size)
I have never shot so many blurry pictures in a 1 week span before
great shots, zoom is great, and nice to handle
It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
I like a mix of AUTO and manual - this one has it, and manual is extremely easy to call up and use, unlike that mode for the other two brands
Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
Nice camera for the price
they stop time .
Kinda makes sense, but just a slight inconvenience because you need to remove the lens cap first, then turn the camera back on
I took a couple of pictures with this came and they came out so beautiful
Unit arrived overnight which was nice
It ivery easy to use and does a great job
Great little camera
I wish the wide zoom (30mm) was better but it's ok
Spectacular camera, terrible computer interface
Would be nice to have a better LCD)No thumb wheel
Also I found the camera to be very prone to silhouetting and washout in outdoor use, and again this is not simply operator error, I am comparing to other similarly-priced cameras I have owned over the years (including various Casio Exilim and Fujifilm FinePix models)
Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well
I have ac delco batts in the camera now
Overall, a wonderful camera with excellent quality photos, great zoom, good size, CMOS chip allows for awesome night shots (for better visibility only
Cons if you call them that:-I am still worried that the lens is going to stick out, but i clean it daily and it hasnt stuck yet
Poor color accuracy, just average sharpness
After several hours of use, the flickering seemed to mostly go away, but not entirely
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
I just got my new camera, I am not a expert in the matter, but I am VERY HAPPY  with this Nikon camera
The camera is small, light weight and easy to handle, and fits well into my hand
unfortunately we are no longer able to
This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this
In fact, I am enjoying this camera more than almost any one I have ever used
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
Really amazing, my expensive 60D doesn't do any better even though I am using the viewfinder and holding the camera steady against my head
Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as "ILCE" ( "interchangeable lens digital camera)
8 allows you to shoot at faster shutter speeds in low light situations because the circle in the lens allows more light to pass through because of the lower aperture
The charger of the battery didn't work, so I need bought a new charger
Nice
While I mainly bought this camera for its photo capabilities, there is no denying that this little guy makes fantastic videos
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
Works for a basic need
I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well
Then the flash cover (plastic) fell off because it is only glued on, and in Mass we have humidity and heat
I was so excited and it doesn't work
I bought the camera because of its zoom
On the cruise I was less worried about packing light and cords and such so I brought both cameras and chose depending on the situation (Nikon at night, Canon on most excursions)
Besides, the thing that matters is the output
Great camera takes good pictures
I was not happy that the camera would not accept any of my 6 cards
Love this camera
my daughter loves it, great for that quick spontaneous picture
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
I like to carry a camera with me at all times and this one was perfect
The older models were like this
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
The camera comes with everything you need to get started, and includes a very helpful handbook with illustrations and all you need to know about this product
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
It takes excellent pictures and the video quality is really stunning
It was also very reasonably priced
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
good
The 1080p HD video is records is unbelievable, then plug the camera right into the TV via HDMI and watch video or view pictures
They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
picture were out of focus all the time; had to return it
Yes, it is a fake DSLR
) The touch screen makes manual settings a breeze
And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also
The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
Great camera if youre looking for a hybrid between DSLR and Compact
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
It took amazing pictures
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras
Also stock up on GOOD rechargeable batteries such Duracell
Nothing Special
I never changed batteries for the whole week in Arizona, and then added another couple of days of battery life in France, and those were with the batteries that came with the camera
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
I'm not crazy about Nikon not supplying a battery charger, instead you charge the battery in the camera with the usb cord
This camera is currently offered at a deeply discounted price (so if you if are considering it and see it for less than $300
A good thing is you only print pictures you like
is the flash placement
All have taken nice pictures in well lit situations
Very good budget camera, even in low light
I liked the Samsung touch screen a lot but I have been hearing about far too many problems with touch screen camera so this one went down the tube after a short short
but it feels like a crutch
Relatively lightweight, beautiful shutter response, and the test of all tests for images--at full resolution, pristinely clear quality (little noise in the right lighting)
I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it
This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get
I decided to go with Nikon as a last resort of ever finding a decent camera at a decent price which someone of decent intelligence could operate
We highly recommend it
The zoom has an autofocus which truly does work
I bought this camera 7 days ago
I purchased this camera after my Nikon Coolpix S8200 broke down on me again for the second time
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
However, I can't go halfway around the world and lose priceless memories to a camera that somehow easily gets scratched or won't operate without doing voodoo
I didn't understand, but I went in Sony store, but they, only sold me a new charger
Being disabled I do not have the luxury of being able to pop round the the Ye Olde Photo Shoppe for a bracing battery refill
Check this one out for yourself for sure!
I was pretty disappointed and decided to return it
Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras
well worth the money
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera
Otherwise, it's a great camera
In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos
But once you start printing straight off of the camera it is such a rush you're actually amazed it is so compact
. lens cap is a really annoying
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
It was great as long as it was working
Seemed like a great deal
Heavy emphasis on connectivity options using wireless, canon online services, NFC, direct print to canon printers
Takes great pictures and videos
However, having it raised, and over the lens does reduce red eye
- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact
In 2011, I returned for a 45 day trip
Great Camera for the price
I have taken very good care of this camera
But after a gorgeous sunset that i caputred with 7 shots and fitted to a panorama
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
What I didn't like about it is that it feels cheap and made of plastic material but Nikon may have done it to make it light in the weight
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not
It even has built in tops to help you take great pictures
The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
he say the pix are great
It also provides lots of shooting modes
When my wife returns I will be able to give an update response so stay tuned
The equivalent of a "Blue Screen of Death" on Windows operating systems
In a nutshell, if you are intent on increasing your range & don't overly care to concern yourself w/manual settings, as well as comparing the intuitive interface, the tilting LCD screen, and most of all, the image quality to the Canon SX510 & other megazooms, I am rather confident believing there is no better camera out there anywhere at this $196 price point
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one
I've always loved taking pictures and this camera is so easy to use and takes great pictures
It's a tad pricey for what it is but, it certainly is a lot of fun
My only wish is that the t5 had come with the sensor cleaning function Canon's earlier models came with
Nothing was done to it and it was sitting on a shelf
After a couple of weeks so far so good
This is a great value in a little interchangeable lens camera with a traditional style view finder
After going to 4 stores, comparing cameras and prices, I decided to go on Amazon
I love this camera
I had a Canon Coolpix, but this is a new and upgraded version
I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji
Can't rate higher than 4 stars because I haven't used this camera
Right on target
The photos are clear and beautiful and the different options are great
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
It makes you look like a PRO Videographer
Best camera ever
SO in the end, would I buy again?
feels solid in hand .
Video is captured by pressing a prominent "Movie" button adjacent to the viewfinder
The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still
we probably are doing something wrong but have not figured it out yet
Overall I think ii is a fine camera
0-Inch LCD (Black)Great features and amazing flexibility
It is light and easy to hold with one hand
It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies
The second big difference is the battery
Photos have nice clarity
big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
Video clips don't always load to my media player
We have 2 small children and the shutter speed had been an issue on the older camera, so we were hoping this would be an upgrade- unfortunately the speed was not much faster
Photos were less sharp in many cases compared to some of my other cameras, mostly due to the aggressive noise reduction
This is stupidly under priced
BUT I REALLY LIKE
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the photographs
2) I did not realize soon enough that this camera does not have the option to take black/white pictures or much less sepia, or any other tones
Great camera / value
I am very pleased with this camera
I use this camera as an alternative to carrying my DSLR
Around 50c a print it's cheaper than film polaroids
It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet
It comes with its own rechargeable battery
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
Oh, and the zoom is beyond awesome, love it
This is a perfect high pixel camera with telephoto lens for travel
All in all, very impressive camera
This is not comparable at all, in any way, to DSLR
It's rather a Sony's NEX camera in a SLR body
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
But it'd print one picture and then say load paper even though there was an entire pack just loaded in
Handing has greatly improved on the T5 over the T3
Have not tried video
Very bad for video
It has a great zoom as long as there is not fast movement
The zoom  brings the picture right to you
This is also the reason that I haven't explored all the features of the camera
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
AF was fast enough for an outdoor event
Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
Never abused.
Being in the military and deployed, this bothers me as I have to continually make a conscious effort to keep the screen from being damaged
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
Amazing camera
It feels great in my XL hands
My wife and I each have carried our own 300HS for about two years
It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon
With the SX700, I am getting very good photos and video, it is always ready to shoot both close ups and distant object, no lens change necessary, and it is light weight and easy to carry
I did a lot of research and bought the Case-Logic case, which is perfect for the camera, and an extra battery or soft bristled brush to dust off the lens housing before stowing it away
The viewer on the back Is a good 3 inches to view your subject but your photos also
It was well worth the wait for my red camera
Nice camera, very simply to use
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
So the camera becomes unavailable during that time
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
3, It uses 4 AA batteries
The images are sharp and the colors are beautiful
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
The only drawback is that it works with AA  batteries but they seem to last long
My fault but I will be getting another
Great camera for the money
Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX
Sure, it's cheap, but I've recently seen dslr's selling for $50-70 more (new)
My only complaint, which ill agree with someone else on
Great pictures and I like the 34x zoom lens
So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD
Good zoom I'm happy
Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well
It's great for those school programs when the lighting is dark
Okay, here's what I hate about this camera:Pros:1) When it takes a good shot it takes a good shot
I could not be more pleased
Battery life seems to be very good as I have been using it
I'm nobody's photographer, but just about every shot I take with this camera comes out blurry
I bought this camera for my wife and she's loving it
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
- takes pretty crappy pictures in bright sunlight
The Panasonic pictures are awesome, it's easy to use and has some great editing features
In my case, I really love it
In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
It took unbelievable pictures and the size
I tried all the cards with the (card) slide switches in both positions and the S8100 would not function, only with it's built-in internal memory
If u can get this kit cheap, or camera, like for $170, then yeah u have yourself a deal
Exceeded my expectations
Then, only a few months later, it just stopped working
Excellent Product
Don't get me wrong I love my Pro Canon EOS camera but this one is very easy to carry, up to date on technology, links to my phone, it's just a perfect all around point and shoot digital with enough manual options to make this semi pro photographer happy
Garbage
A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
It might survive a knock or two, though
Definitely recommend
I recommend this product 100%
Camera looks nice  and the  zoom is  very nice
I was a bit skeptical because the price of this camera was so low, so I went to walmart to try it out and fell in love
The flash is very weak.
Also the image quality was very sub-par
At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it &#34;repaired&#34; not knowing what happened
I’ve even linked it to my iPhone5 over Wi-Fi and like the ability to transfer pictures so that I can post some immediately on Flickr or Facebook
Great little camera
easy navigate menu8
Sony A3000 Super Value
i love it and i would recommend it to many people
I've sent two back so far - any recommendations on the best bag for the S8100 are welcome
OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
After thousands of photos, it is ready for retirement
Trying to fill a novelty niche, but falls horribly short
Bought it as a gift
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
This camera has a rechargeable LI-ON battery, and this is an improvement over my older camera that uses AA batteries
Also zooming and focusing sounds can be heard very loudly in any shot video
4) BIGGEST COMPLAINT BY FAR:  Although the camera takes great pictures in in dimly lit rooms in terms of visibility (awesome nightshot of an old town street in exas - looks like it was still dusk), but the camera is a horrific disaster when it comes to clarity
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
most of the time when you look at what you are going to photo thepicture is red
In this age of modern electronics, the camera itself is a plastic coated, clunky, over sizepiece of junk with what appears to be a plastic lens
you can see the moon and every detail perfectly
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
also, the photo came out printed, there was no waiting for the picture to &#34;develop&#34; which is cool but isnt polaroid-ish
Low light performance was particularly dissapointing, and white balance was very eratic
I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
The Nikon COOLPIX L830 was my choice
Our son is due any day and I know she has been dying to make a scrapbook
We both liked it so much that I bought another one for myself
but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition
Uses real batteries
yep .
Just something to get used to
I'm finding this to be quite untrue, and it is unlike every camera I have used in the past
I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000
This camera doesn't fully satisfy my needs and I'm overall a little disappointed
Feature-rich, user-friendly, and captures excellent images
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge
It is easy to use
This old school camera is perfect for preserving memories and instant prints
I look forward to taking pictures from my window of deer and critters that wander into the far reaches of the yard
Takes great pictures for the price
Included software lets you make a JPEG from movie frame
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
I'm really upset about that
The zoom also bothered me due to A LOT of shakiness, which I understand happens at the highest zoom and being hand held, but again, I didn't experience that much of it with my previous camera
(3) OUTSTANDING low-light no-flash performance
Even higher ISO were less noisy than some other camera's in the same price range
Awesome Camera
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
There are numerous features and the menu system can be a little daunting, but I tend not to get carried away with all of those special scene features
Nice pics and versatile equipment
The pictures are great
The display is great (or so I am told since I can't really see it)
It is a fun gadget but quality of the camera and prints could be better
The digital zoom is crap.
This Camera Horrible
I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
Great Camera
One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like
Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me
a big plus in my book .
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
I like the WiFi remote control in this camera
This is such a vast improvement over that first one that it's hard for me not to be enthusiastic about it
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
The body is very cheap
it is made of plastic .
This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors
I also looked at the newer model just out of curiousity
The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime
I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing
And when u record video in low light, it makes a movie shutter sound, which can lead to it breaking bcuz I hit it  repeatedly thinking something was jammed
It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
Zoom is awesome
The pictures we have taken so far are so crisp and clear it will blow you away
The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
I would reccomend this to everyone
buy this camera and savour it .
Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy
The only problems I've run into is I didn't realize there was no manual mode, and when its at its highest zoom it make a beeping nose( does not interfere with video)
The LCD screen is tough to use for manual focus and you cannot see anything sharply through the QVGA Tru-Finder - viewfinder at all, no matter how you adjust the dial
So, I researched several cameras and this had the price that I needed on my budget but also have nearly as much total zoom as those competing cameras had at twice the price
For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition
Light, very light
Nikon coolpix
I would be the first to say, "Canon has done it again," were I not also an owner of the ill-fated sx280
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
-The flash assembly seems frail I am very happy with this camera and I highly recommend it
This camera has all of the features that I was looking for
I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera
Found it on Amazon for $199 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping
Very nice zoom, now I can get decent pictures of my child's sports events from the sidelines
This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
Love the tilting screen and the pic quality is very nice
So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]
- battery must be charged in camera, which means attached to the cord
) I also like the separate video button, rather than having to select "video" on the dial then press record
Anyway, I liked this camera, is a beautiful color (I have in red) and I am not professional but I can take good pictures with it
Its very expensive from Canon ($35+), I have a cheap knock-off that lasts almost as long and cost $6
I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
The metal housing seems very rugged.
Picture quality is bad, shutter cant stop action, file sizes are miniscule, the in camera effects look like they're from 2004
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
It doesn't help that the couple of online &#34;reviews&#34; of this camera say that it DOES have an orientation sensor, nor does it help that Sony's website doesn't say anything about it at all
Great pictures just forget the Wi Fi
I highly recommended
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
and does very well in low light
The a3000 (also a5000) are probably just what the serious but cheap amateur needs - a second body
I do not see that many pixels on the photos, it is so frustrating
fiance did n't like the feel .
So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken
The 300HS is a basic auto camera that fits very nicely in my pants pocket
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
love the speed and ease of the features and captures
I was looking for new camera that took nice close-ups of family as well as my crafts
As a 3D VXF hobbyist, I especially like the auto HDR mode and the bracketed modes
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life
We have always had trouble getting good shots of the kids during school programs due to poor lighting, I dont think that will be the problem anymore after using this camera at night
no instructions .
came close on this one
Good quality and fun!
but I would rather have it be noisy and fast, just to have access
S graduation, just enough time to learn the basics
Pictures look great on big flat screen TV's
Same for high over head pics
Takes nice, crisp photos with vivid color
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
Cool idea but bad execution
I do appreciate the night pictures and the 12mp
Very nice and compact with the easy of use for features but almost all picture were blurry when used on stand or taken by camera in hand
Both the 820 and the 830 came with neck straps so hopefully they'll fare better
Be aware that you have to pay the return postage and a hefty restocking fee
So based on the previous reviewers who give their pros and cons, thank you so much
And it's not even noisy (grainy)
I am positive the lens wasn't bumped while it was extended so it is just an unreliable mechanism
Your photos would come out darker if you're zooming in far out subject on cloudy day but with 34x zoom you should be using a tripod and taking photo when there is suffrciant light behind you and onto the subject, camera does compensate for shake but that is more effective when you're taking a portrait but when you're zoning in 30 times even a slight hand shake will multiply 30 times
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
This is the best camera I have ever owned
Battery life was good, and picture quality was great
Much better
Decent camera but I returned it
00 so I began my search for a new camera
This is a GREAT hybrid camera for the price
Love it
does a great job at so little price
3- USB kicks!
The L830 meets my needs
I highly recommend this camera
Great camera
In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera
For camera users who have larger hands, the A3000 is indeed much easier to handle than a NEX3N, for example
We received the product and within 1 month it was already broken
It is very easy to use and very compact with professional quality pictures
Colors are good and images are SHARP
Beefy enough to hold comfortably in one hand and takes great pictures easy
yes, a Sony
sure .
I bought this camera about 6 months ago to have something more portable then my D-SLR, and it has went beyond my expectations for a point and shoot camera
Control layout is largely unchanged and remains pretty straight-forward to operate
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
The best compact zoom camera
Flash pop up is new but getting use to it
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
Great Camera
Wanted to do a replacement, but this seller does not offer this exchange
The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is
She never reads the instruction manuals for any of our electronics, but picked it up and started using it day 1 w/o issue
It doesn't explain the different modes at
Very good contrast
WOW
) And the price was reasonable
It is, of course, not covered by warranty -- after 4 months
I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job
Very simple easy to use, lightweight, and it takes good quality photos
Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
This camera is amazing
One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is "A3000", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number "ILCE-3000')
That pricepoint is just laughable
My husband needed a camera that corrected for shake, and so far, this one is impressive
The other downside is the video: It does take good video quality, but the mic picks up the zoom and auto focus
If I never see it again, I won't be disappointed
Photo and screen quality are amazing, zoom is impressive for a compact camera, the navigation wheel is very handy and startup is quick
I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
I don't want to have to tweak a point-n-shoot
Excellent camera
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
Did I mention the pictures in a dimly-lit room come out blurry?  I had to return it
s8100
This camera is excellent
at a price I could afford
Nikon has an update (version 1
Good telephoto and macro for internet,  and I am able to get photos of the dogs, so far I am very pleased
I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
It had more uses than I expected so I'm still learning
;  A few firmware fixes will make this camera shine
Things like the drumset will be in focus but anything moving like the drummer will be blurred
The strap, which is also included, helps this camera to feel nice and secure around my neck
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
This camera is great
The camera overall is great in the fact you don't need different zoom lenses and it works much like the small camera versions only with a little more bells and whistles
I'm just disappointed that it was hyped so much and it doesn't hold up to its name
I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
-CMOS is AWESOME
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
I was really stressed about which type of camera to buy and was unsure on if this camera would work
The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
Haven't found any large flaws yet
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus
But really no complaints for the price I paid($279)
This camera that takes high resolution pictures, vivid colors, is reasonably priced
It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing
I love it
This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera
I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be
Hopefully Polaroid will improve it in future versions
I'm sure others will be perfectly happy with it but it's not the camera for me
End of story.
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
Zoomed in to take a  nice still picture,  and the deer looks like it was standing right in front of her
It failed at both
Easy menu and correct weight
When I received my camera I was so excited
You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto
Seriously Nikon?  Put a viewfinder in this camera and it would get 10 stars
You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it
After following all of their directions for mailing my camera (costing close to $20), I receive my estimate of repairs
It takes great pictures, is a good size, and works quickly
it works)
Very good budget camera, even in low light
I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing
not so much here
Recommend a SD card with at least a class 4 rating (the 1080p is a a lot of data to write)
I've also played with the Continuous and timer modes to get some amazing full moon pictures
Recognizing the features this does not seem to be a great problem
I don't mind the flash position that everyone seems to dislike
So I went for this one, hoping that I would see a dramatic improvement
Very nice camera, only problem is a common problem with all cameras that use only a monitor screen and no viewfinder is that they are very difficult to see on a sunny day
Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
4) It is a battery eater
(always keep an extra set
This is a great product for the money, I needed an upgrade from my compact camera and this is pretty, lightweight and takes great pics
Newly acquired
Delighted
YOU CAN BE a artistic pro with the CREATIVE SHOT option which with 1 push of the shutter button gives you 6 different shots, with different effects, and different crops and zooms
so I can charge a battery without it being in the camera, which seems to be an issue with some users
Besides, the thing that matters is the output
I'm disappointed there aren't more settings (the point-and-shoot digital camera I bought back in 2006 seems to have more) or it's not intuitively obvious how to use them
These do not affect the resulting photos and videos
I really can't complain about this camera
Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise
The have some great options that allow you to shoot 1mp at 120 fps, or 12mp at a decent rate
Battery life, not as good as others, but OK
For the price, could have included an SD card and instruction manual
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
Disappointing
It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light
I'm very pleased with this camera
Much easier to use than my old film-version Nikon of technology from the ancient past
I have had this little gem for four months now.
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
It is a digital point and shoot that prints but has some limitations
Great Little Camera
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
It is interesting that there are so many negative reviews on this product - but in looking at them most of them are related to the video quality, not still image which is uniformly rated 5, or in only some cases a 4
It was a great addition
This camera is really sturdy and well made
But I found a charger with a car adapter and a 2nd Nikon battery for only $26 here on Amazon so that takes care of that
It is bigger, but a better camera and printer
So Far The Best Pictures but Still Somewhat Weak In Low Light
The adapter for these is always on the camera
No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment
Some people want to complain about the noise
I know whoever has this one is pleased with it
It can take pictures even in the darkest place
Full HD 1920 x 1080, 60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format
The camera is light and has a great sensor, but it's a pain to shoot
Easy to use
Love love this camera
Yes, as some of the reviewers have pointed out, there are some design issues maybe, some things that could be better, but overall, I have been very pleased
Takes great photos
Love it
Am totally happy with it
actually, I like the L830 more
I did adjust a few of the setting for the auto mode to get increased consistency and more true to life images
CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
Still photos at high resolution you can even see stitching in knit sweater
I also had a hard time getting the flash to work to fill in backlighting, etc
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body
You just need to learn about the camera and what the different scenes and adjustments do
Attention to detail lacking
I would recommend this camera to folks of all ages
This is a gadget in all the sense of the word, not something professional photographers or nitpickers should get, because you will be disappointed
audio on video also lacking .
In the stores it was $299, on sale for $249
Things in general are fast, except for two problems which I discuss below
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
I don't think another 12" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use
Both have the same sensor so they both perform about the same image-quality wise
It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
Great camera, good price
just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done
(2) Ease of use - it doesn't matter if you're used to another brand of pocket camera before: this one is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
I also recommend not using the continuous AF (you'll hear clicking sounds in the video)
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
Super pictures and nice feature set all at a reasonable price
Battery life is too short and the battery has to be in the camera for it to recharge
With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
The camera only shoots jpg or Raw+Jpg , you cannot shot just RAW
This may be a hassle for some people but since I choose what pictures to print and save, not so much of a dealbreaker, just wanted to point it out to others
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
Great pics and easy to use
Normally I don't give items a one-star review, but this one has earned it
We bought this camera to replace our three year old one
It is easy to use
Although, if Nikon decides to add a night vision capability to this camera, sign me up
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
I know I've still yet to explore everything my Sony has to offer but I'm so proud to share the pix I've been taking with it pretty much right out of the box
Just get familiar with the menu and settings
Good Photo Quality
But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box
These are some of her best shots
I love the ease of use and the light weight
I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6
Poor quality photos even with the more expensive photo paper
Love this camera
Neither of us cared for the necessity of charging the battery in the camera and preferred an immediately replaceable battery but it turns out most better quality cameras are of this species so we bought an extra batt to solve that issue
Doing a lot of low-light work? The ISO range of the T5i is larger: T5 100 - 12,800 vs T5i 100 - 25,600The T5i has a 9 point cross-type Autofocus  vs only 1 in the T5The T5 has about 100 shots MORE of battery life than the T5i
Fun for what it is
The images were superb and the ease of operation was perfect for my armature skill level
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
lovely camera
The paper is a bit expensive but what I love about this Polaroid instant camera over other instant cameras (by Fujifilm etc
Who knowsÖ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
All had the same results.
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
6) It labels videos as "images" so that when you want to replay or delete them, it's confusing, and you might accidentally delete a video thinking it's an image
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
If you can get past those two things, this is a great choice
It feels very solid
Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting
I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
Great skin color
Problem with edges
The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing
I haven't actually used it yet, but it's a Nikon, need I say more? Love the red color and the size
The menus also offer a great set of tips to help new users understand even the more advanced features
Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
Need to purchase memory
I thought I might miss a digital viewfinder but discovered that, with the brightness turned up on the LCD, the viewfinder was quite useable in bright sunlight and the view is stunning in hi resolution
It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient, even when shooting video, since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera
splash !
It looks awesome on the viewer but after the button is pushed the picture is fuzzy somewhat
I have gone through over 10 different point and shoot cameras over the past 13 years
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
No one does true color better than Nikon, and its AUTO mode is off the charts spot-on, even for difficult shots in weird light with subtle effects (sun pooling through a forest canopy, for example, or dusk on a street as the neon lights come on)
They are absolutely amazing
No other point and shoot can top this camera
I found both just fine
which slows down the speedThe most unacceptable issue of this camera, is the image quality it provides
The low light image quality is far better than all other point n shoot cameras and significantly better than those &#34;fit in the jeans pocket&#34; cameras
Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great
I was able to take lots of great pics & print the picture out & give them out to the guests at the party as presents :) When you buy this camera buy a SD card too so you can have lots of pics saved to camera
How can you beat that?Oh, and the color of the red camera is the most gorgeous shade of red I've ever seen
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
cool nikon
But compared to a regular digital camer this is very poor quality
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
If you like using your phone to take instagrams your going love this camera
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
The Rebel line of Canons has produced some incredible cameras such as the T3
Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video
Back to Canon
For the past week, I've been reading the manual from cover to cover both learning what this camera can do along with deciphering all the technical lingo
My beef with this camera started the very first time I turned it on
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great
It seemed to recharge quickly using an electrical outlet but took a couple hours using the USB plugged into a laptop
I've only had it for a week but I can see it being my best friend soon
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
I wish it had broken a month earlier so that I could just return it to Amazon but now we have to deal directly with Nikon, which has been a pain
The continuous shooting is not as good as my DSLR, but still very acceptable
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
All things considered I would definitely recommend this camera
I do like the tilting view screen, though, which is something I've never seen before
Love the Nikon Coolpix l830
it is a little bit heavier and bigger than what I had expected a mirrorless camera would be, but still way lighter and smaller than a regular DSLR
I really honestly don't see how anybody with larger hands could find the SL1 comfortable to shoot with given its very shallow grip
Well worth the cost
Nothing was done to it and it was sitting on a shelf
Good Camera
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
Does not come with an SD card, so you'll need to purchase one
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
I asked to one guy take a picture of us and he couldn`t believe how good was the camera and he asked me where I bought it
Really want to like Nikon but not sure I can buy from them again
It almost makes the video useless
I do not want to be confined to Canon software to annotate, organize, and store my photos and download via Wi-Fi
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
Defective piece
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
Feels good in your hand and easy to handle
No matter what the lighting is, it seems like every shot I take with this camera is blurry
I ordered this camera about 6 months ago
digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings
I put in an unused card I had in my desk drawer and it worked after some fiddling in the menu
This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook)
This camera is it
its continuous shooting mode
I did a lot of research on cameras before purchasing this one
looks more sturdy and easy to hold on hand than SX519
This camera takes great pictures, very simple to operate
anyway, I could not get passed it
I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point & shoot that takes fantastic pictures, and has pretty good video capabilities with a good zoom, and is well built that will fit in your pocket
As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
Shipped quickly
It shoots nice pictures
The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
the only point and shoot that satisfy your photography
Thank you, Missby
I tested this camera on the auto mode and it has totally impressed me
It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable
The centre button is no longer customisable
What I observed through the view screen was stunning
Three Stars
It even has built in tops to help you take great pictures
I highly recommend this camera
Doesn't work well in low light even with the flash
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
Of course this happened right after the warranty expired, and Nikon's website said they could fix it for a price
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
I am not a photographer so the point and shoot works great for me
I wanted a camera that took awesome pictures and this new Nikon Coolpix L830 does that with ease
The image quality is great
Grear
I am no professional photographer so I am happy I can get a grat picture with the touch of a button and I don't have to play with the settings or anything
everything else about the camera is great .
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
Neither of these Transcend cards or any of the other 4 SD cards I already had would work in the camera
if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
It is hot enough to be annoying.
This camera is huge
I purchased this camera to take with me on a trip to Africa
Great little inexpensive camera
The photos are just breathtaking and better than anything I've ever seen or was able to accomplish with any other camera
My Nikon S8100 failed on the second day of use after about 20 shots with a fatal lens error
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get
It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback)
The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses
had it for a week .
The pictures are awesome, and I would not have had it fixed for that price except, if the USB/AV port is bad, you cannot upload photos OR charge the battery
It is such an upgrade from my previous camera
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
Like it
I did pull several pics off my computer and loaded them on an Sd card for printing
The bulky size to accommodate the 4 AA batteries and lack of a viewfinder (a common complaint for most LCD cameras) cost this other great camera one star
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
Good camera for the price
I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point
Easy to operate and hold
The zoom on this is really good, even from the 20 yd line I was able to snap close up pics of the colts on the opposite end of the field
The last camera I had was left in an airport in Portugal and not recovered
I can get it to reclose by taking the battery out and in, saying voodoo and sometimes, out of desperation, pushing the lens physically
You can also select which picture you would like to print which is great
Delivery was on time as promised
Top Camera
Perfect camera, feels good and sturdy, takes excellent pictures
I understand you can buy a separate battery-charger
Nikon L830
The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus
Daughter's First  Camera
Low quality camera
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
Nice photos
You can view your pictures without the lens being extended
This is about the 20th digital camera I've purchased, and other than the rugged pentax optio that I bought a couple of years ago, this is the ONLY ONE that does not have an ORIENTATION SENSOR
maybe because it is all plastic
I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera
The placement is absurd
I purchased this awesome camera a little over a year & a half ago and it is by far the best digital camera I have purchased by far
I've had a heck of a time with this camera
im so disgusted and after reading nikon help center reviews I now know not to bother even calling
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
Good video too and much moreFor the beginner
it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
Otherwise fantastic camera
At the wide-angle end, the optics are unflattering for portraits (more than SLR wide-angles)
I typically carry a Canon 40D and a 1DmkII but i wanted something smaller to carry around
Excellent price point for a camera of this caliber
Like it's predecessor, the Canon T5 is a no-frills DSLR whose primary focus is taking decent pictures
You can't go wrong
I have been having my T2 for some years now for sports photography
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
Also it has a very quality and good looking finish
In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
That is quite a claim, but I be leave it's true
You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
I hope they pay Ashton Kutcher alot for his advertising because thats what lead me to this camera
Unfortunately I thought it was a viewfinder camera and it is not
But, based on the reviews from consumer reports Nikon was a top camera so I thought I would try it out
Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7
WORKS LIKE A CHARM
I an very happywith my choice of camera
My favorite is the &#34;hand held twilight&#34; mode - perfect for getting shots without a flash, just make sure your subjects holds steady
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
I've only had this camera for a few days and am having a blast
I bought my wife one after she lost her camera somewhere
This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
Excellent
In bright indoor lighting, it may be  better to use aperture priority mode, choose the largest aperture available (3
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
This is the second Nikon camera i bought in the past 6 months
I had been using an SLR from a competitor, and decided that it was too much for me to learn
I have been able to order some off Amazon but if I run out, I cannot just go to the store and get more
It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
I wanted something a little more sophisticated than a point and shoot and this camera is terrific
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
Returned it to Amazon and got a replacement
Very poor picture quality
I have never had a Coolpix before, so I'm in the early learning stages with it
again all in-camera
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
This camera is extremely user-friendly, the battery life is great, and the photo quality, pretty darn good
Great purchase
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
I have used this camera for both photos and video recording
Camera startup is reasonably speedy, something less than 3 seconds from start/focus/take picture in low light ( faster outside)
Perfect for outdoors
Super photos on a recent trip
Another unfortunate feature is that the proprietary charging cable is lost (as in my case), there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get one - I imagine I will have to call Polaroid because the cable is not available on Amazon or the Polaroid website
On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
Picturetastic
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
I hope Canon fixes the GPS tagging app so it uses less battery on the phone
Disappointed
It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6
this compact Nikon arrived today and it took all of 3 minutes to prepare it and turn it on, which is as quick as claimed
I thought the picture would come out at lot better
but remember you need the right amount of light to get the Best quality out of the Pictures and Video
Oh and I love the deep red color
easy to upload and print photos
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
before they are sold out !
Good camera, recommend
The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
He took great shots
GoodThe zoom works wellThe camera is smallIt has a rechargeable lithium battery
The only drawback is the EVF really lacks clarity
The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
ONE FABULOUS PHOTO TAKER
seriously ! i love it !
I am very pleased with my purchase.
Nikon coolpix L830
ever
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
Sharp image
That's why I took it back
Reasonable size (fits in pocket)
Twilight mode is slow when it has to take multiple shots and combine the pictures into one
photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
this was a pretty good buy
I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
The only reason it didn't get a 5th star is because of the camera software inside
So much more you can do than just pictures
It wasn't as it was described
excellent idea !
None of these is a show-stopper for me, and there is indeed a lot to like, but I can't call this the best camera ever made
Great for the money - close ups with flash it too much some times
This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook)
but it does make it a worthy consideration if you are shopping on a tight budget
It does have a useful, though low-resolution panorama mode for those who don't want to make the effort to combine multiple photos using image processing software
Great for newbies
The viewfinder picture is a bit less clear than I would like and somewhat small but manageable
(i can't help but play with the camera always)
