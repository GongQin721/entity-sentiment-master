from the time you press the shutter activate button to the time it focuses and the shutter goes, it's nearly 2 seconds which is eons
but it does make it a worthy consideration if you are shopping on a tight budget
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions
I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers
What a waste of time & money -- are the pictures worth it?  I probably could have gotten shots just as nice from a Canon or Kodak (and will in the future)
And the quality of the pictures printed from it are not very good
Great for scrap-booking
it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2
I have owned quite a few digital cameras over the last ten years
I wanted a new camera, but I didn't want to spend too much money on it
why ?
The photo and video quality is excellent
Ive read complaints about size but you get what you get for what your getting
Very clear
com, these are the A3000's key features:20
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
I bought this camera for my mother
So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues
It's really easy to use, which is a good thing
comfortable size and style
Some of the picky reviews I read tells me these guys are clueless operators or have a malfunctioning unit (It happens to the best)I admit it took me some head-scratching to understand both of the photo programs that arrived in the camera box for loading into the computer
The number one reason to get a camera like this is the full manual controls over such things as shutter speed and aperture
Not soft
Just isn't fast enough and I always get a blur
LOVE MY NIKON
I didn't realize it came with it's own battery and a charger for it
There are lots of options on the camera, but the instruction manual that comes packaged with it is totally useless, only shows you how to work the basic function to take pictures, so I had to experiment with the different settings to find what works best
Lens Error Strikes Again
I am used to a huge professional camera, this is small compact and takes great pictures
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji
There is even the (very useful) option of a slower continuous shot mode
You can use built in differnt scenery mode or let camera decide it for you
I sent it back
Mine died after only 2 days
Sharp image
Since you need to be mindful of the flash placement, holding this camera is awkward further exasperating the issue
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
Though it is still better (yes even the audio) than the Flip (any generation) or Kodak Zi8 & Zi10 for video
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
The short videos were excellent quality and meant I didn't need to lug my video camera along
This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings
i love the quality of the pictures .
I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
Just what  wanted
I absolutely love how the pictures turn out
Looking at pictures taken with a Canon T3, and this, there is no comparison
This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options
A backward stepIt is still difficult to find functions in the menu system
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
BAD PRINT QUALITY
its size is smaller and good for travel
However the users manual is practically worthless
21 Days, one suitcase, I go light
I am surprised others have not mentioned this, though perhaps I received a defective unit
In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum
Love both cameras
I ordered this camera for a European trip because I did not want to lug around my large and heavy Canon 40D, and I wanted higher quality photos that can be achieved from a cell phone
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
I am very happy with my purchase
And for the video, if you leave it set to continuous AF, when you play it back you can hear the focus mechanism clicking over and over again to regain focus
HD video: One of my favorite things about this line of cameras is you can shoot video at 1080p which is very high-resolution and looks great on high definition televisions and even on YouTube
It is actually very light and came with a nice leather case
I wanna go shoot something
Feature-rich, user-friendly, and captures excellent images
I love this camera
But I am sure I will love using it
EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
This item had sold out, but then again it was about 2 weeks before the holiday
Great camera and so far I have no complaints on it at all
and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
I love this camera!
Some people have been complaining that it feels a bit flimsy & like a toy camera
I had to send it back to Nikon for repair, which they did because it was still covered by warranty
By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
Bought it for before/after pics for my refinishing biz, does the job
The quailty of the printed picture is not decent at all
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
Close up is awesome
Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
I thought I was always going to be a Cannon guy, but found out differently
You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY
However, it does not have rechargable batteries which is a big must for me
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
I couldn't use it the entire trip
All I have to do is point the camera at the picture I want and click
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body
i am very pleased with it so far .
Great for pictures as well as for taking movies on the fly
Flash and battery door pop up seems flimsy and I felt it won't last very many use or break off on slight mishandling
No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
But overall it's fast and dependable
So far it is doing exactly as advertised
Great compact camera that probably rivals entry level DSLR models
The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built
My experience with the 280 really shook my faith in Canon but I decided to take a chance with the sx700 in hopes of getting essentially a 280 that worked
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing
Easy menu and correct weight
I have never owened a better camera
I should have practiced more before leaving home
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
I'm very unhappy with this camera
The controls were poor and very simplistic
Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera
The whole idea behind this camera is "magazine quality images" for as little money as possible
The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a viewfinder, which I don't remember seeing in the description at all
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
HD video is captured in the
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
It's not very heavy and really it's not too thick, it's about the length of your thumb (unless you have really, really big thumbs)
Great so far
And the color of picture is not as beautiful as sony
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
I do not plan on using the video feature, other than perhaps on a rare occasion, as I bought it to carry around in inclement weather more than anything, rather than expose the D90 or the D300s to winters elements
That's something I always look for when buying a new camera
My son printed out a little 2 by 3 picture that he took of he and his brother in law and it is perfect for my wallet
I got a picture of a bald eagle, sitting on a telephone pole, on the other side of the Yellow River, must have been 60-70 yards away
You can't go wrong
I suppose this camera works well for some, but I can't offer any more than a tepid recommendation that it does work
The best mirrorless camera I've used to-date
I enjoy all the options and the zoom is spectacular
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
A couple of years ago I bought a small point-and-shoot (S230) which worked very well when outdoors in good light and was very, very portable, fitting easily into any pocket I had
The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true
Enough has been said on the reviews to add my comments in any detail, but overall this is a great camera - great photos so far in a variety of lighting conditions
If only it could fit in my pocket
However I did not want just any camera that used AA Battery power
All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate
This is great
Very user friendly
It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback)
I got it a little over a year ago, and I should have returned it from the get-go
I often find that my fingers confuse the issue without my intention or permission
the lowest price I could find for a repair was $200
Wonderful first camera or as a step up without spending big bucks
The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still
I don't really care about this, but it's kinda fun and is a bonus
I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
I've had similar cameras and for the amount of photos I've taken I would have gone through 2-3 battery changes, and I'm still on the first set of batteries
After reading the reviews on several different sites and looking at ratings, this camera is well worth the money
Used at our daughters graduation outdoors
was a gift for teen  who just loves it
Cons: No high-speed-shutter scene mode, which makes this unacceptable for my travel camera
IT IS however for the photographer looking for an innovative and unique product with multiple capabilities
I wanted a DSLR, but didn't have the money for one
less than a year, so many issues OMG really? I have had cheapos from walmart lasting 20 years, I also own $2000 cameras and never an issue, btw they are canon's, but wanted a small light weight camera and nikon was suppose to be good
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
The camera even recognizes how many people are in the frame by placing a square over each face to focus
LOVE IT
They are absolutely amazing
Sure, it's cheap, but I've recently seen dslr's selling for $50-70 more (new)
Great bag with the all-important AW cover
I can zoom in all the way and still capture a clear crisp shot of it
This camera takes series of photos and processes the best image
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
Amazing Camera but No Manual Mode
I was also looking for a camera to take non-flash pictures at events such as communions and dance recitals
I said, can your fancy camera do that?
Easy to set up and use
Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
I'm really enjoying having a camera so small and lightweight
The COOLPIX L830 is a very sophisticated camera for the price
They looked better than all of my friends pictures by far and they had way more expensive bulkier camera's than I did
Amazing quality and so easy to use
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
Get out and about and enjoy
I love the one button on and off for the video
I read that in other reviews but thought it would be worth it if I was careful
but that was what we were looking for
So far, so good
LOLIt really is a great camera
i highly recommend it .
I love my new camera
The challenge has always been low light and indoors
Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
(SanDisk, Toshiba, Panasonic and Lexar)
Much better
warning - i did read the manual !
] This camera is a quality product and I bought it despite, or because of the Ashton Kutcher commercials(I'm not too sure)
I now have two of these A3000's
The power button on top can easily be accidentally toggled as well
Also the exposure looks fine on the screen but when seen on viewer/computer, it's a bit too dark
However, I've used this camera on a family vac and really have no complaints about using batteries
The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
The photos it takes on its tiny,3x2 overpriced film are smeary,blurry, out of focus snaps with absolutely no value
Excellent camera that takes high quality pictures quickly and easily
I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus
But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money
Sure, a DSLR (who's lens would cost more than this camera
the A37 operates the same way
The -4 to +3 5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera
It comes loaded with goodies
I thought the pictures would turn out clearer
What a great compact camera
But it was quick and easy
This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
I could forgive the lack of control if the image quality was spectacular, but it is far from it
This is a beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
Love this camera
It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it
It does very well with totally automatic as well with aperture and time control
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough
It's a really good choice
I&#8217;m not sure Sony&#8217;s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
Great Product
There are a couple of things I did not like
You can't really get much better than this for a quality point and shoot camera, and the price is reasonable
Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]
I bought a kodak camera which I returned because it was terrible and this nikon has been a wonderful replacement
I liked the idea of a viewdinder and a hotshoe,both of which my nex doesnt have
The video is very good although not great
Super cool
I was very happy with this purchase at first
jpg and the dslr shooting
the instruction sheet is in very fine print
Excellent price point for a camera of this caliber
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken
personally i dont know why anyone would use this
This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
i didnt wait to experiment .
I tried out the comparable Canon and Lumix before deciding on this one
The L830 has to be manually released to function, but knowing that
Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel
I use this on a daily purpose for work but would not like to have it for personal use
If you currently shoot DSLRs, this is a good camera for when you want something light and simple to pack along with you rather than bringing all your gear
WORST CAMERA EVER
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
It's not in the supposed condition
Favorable reviews insist on the excellent price of this camera
Recently swapped my much heavier Nikon D90 for the much lighter Sony A3000, since owning this new camera my interest in photography has gone through the roof
It also came with charges for any country you may be using it in
I wanted a digital point and shoot that I could use in the place of my bulky Canon SLR
The picture was breathtaking
It is also easier for me to hold my camera steady when using the viewfinder
I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point
There is a problem with the USB/AV port on the camera
Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
I received this camera for Christmas and love it
Also, after 2 months the lens cover stopped opening when we turned on the power rendering the camera unusable
"the lightweight alternative"
This camera has broken twice on me
I used POGO 2x3 papers (cheaper) and the premium photo papers (expensive) and can not tell the difference between the two
It's a wonderful concept in the sense that you can print whichever pictures you want without wasting film like other polaroids and save them
Its awful
I printed out the online manual which yielded 204 pages
The video works great also and zoom works equally well for the video
Five Stars
When I saw the ad I was thrilled as I had checked it out before going to Amazon
I recommend it to everyone
Great for vacation snapshots
i definately recommend a large memory card .
I gave the camera as a gift and though it's fairly large in size, considering it has a printer included I'd say the the size is perfect
Great "Multipurpose" and  Small Digital Camera
And I've played some with the video
It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
It then combines the two shots giving a true to life image of the the person and background
I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
I especially love the fact that it is mirrorless and weighs less than a traditional dslr, this has no effect on the picture quality however
Auto settings work well
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
very easy to operate
Met all my expectations and more, even impressed my friend that such a small camera could take such nice pictures and be so versatile
I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
As such, the A3000 does not have a pentaprism/mirror of a traditional DSLR
This camera does the trick at portability and takes great pictures for a hand-held pocket sized camera
can use hot shoe6
Beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
The strap, which is also included, helps this camera to feel nice and secure around my neck
Nice Camera
-- lousy content aside, the videos turn out great
right where your left finger holds the camera
This is a great camera
The T5 has a fixed screen like the T3
Then turn it on and press the 'menu' button
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
I heard a lot of great reviews, and decided to buy it
That zoom is amazing
flaws ?
I've purchased two of these cameras for gifts and the recipients were delighted
It is easy to use, easy to hold and the moveable viewfinder is great
My biggest problem with the camera is that I can't find a camera pouch to suit it
I bought this camera because it was supposed to be fast and take good low light pictures
But it would be better priced at around $50 -- not almost $200
Great correspondence, prompt service
I think I should have went with a 8Gig SanDisk Ultra PLUS  that had a faster transfer rate
Although small, it is still better than noneIt has a mode dial like a real dSLR
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
Have used the camera already, and find it to be everything it should be
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
I have an NEX 7, and this was bought so that i could keep my telephoto on my neck while i had a wide angle
This is the best camera in its class, that is, the best compact zoom
(6) Perhaps a bit overzealous on the noise correction
BEST Digital handy
(6) Face recognition actually works
No memory card is provided
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
I can throw this in my backpack and take it anywhere
this camera performs like i can not believe !
Neat little camera
Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
What complicates matters is that the Canon Rebel SL1 is in the same neighborhood price wise and comes with the better 18-55 STM lens, better LCD (though not that much better), better burst performance and is in a more compact body
Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies
Was looking for a small camera with a great zoom and this is it
The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
If taking movies, it can work for only less than one hour
In my opinion some options, like scenes or light setup, should be acessed with the external bottom, without the obligation to go to Menu
My son is using it to launch his youtube career -- he really needs to focus on college
And the video quality is amazing.
She was thrilled
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
It is VERY noticeable and renders the beautiful looking video just about useless
In the end I decided to go with the Nikon and I was not disappointed
I have always had Canon's for a pocket sized camera but really thought this one was it
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
It's great for what it is
The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough
I give it 4 stars only because the GPS function is missing
If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
Fantastic camera, I have wanted to buy this camera for some time (my son has one), finally it came down to my price range
I also like that the pictures are also stickers
It even exposes the flash correctly
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
The battery life is great, the picture quality is great, it is a complete package
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
In my case, flash comes up whenever there is not enough light unless I turn it off
Bought this camera for many reasons and so far it's great
My still pictures of hummingbirds are praised by all who see them
The video also has more artifacts than the NEX or alpha cameras
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
She really likes that the pictures double as stickers
I have just played with it, learning to use it, so far it has been great, suggest a tripod for the extra long zoom shots
AMAZING CAMERA
I never sent it it to get it &#34;repaired&#34; for a whole 200 dollars
I'll keep this short and to the point
Only thing I'm not to happy about it the cover for where you plug in the cord for charging
There is a lot of value in the features
Great zoom, very good Continuous
I don't mind the cheap plastic
CONS:1) Picture quality is not always the best, you have to learn what setting works for what scene
It fits in your pocket.
I love that you can tilt the screen, it came in handy so many times
The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
Horrible quality
the photos looks very natural
Love this
Although the SX700 is a pocket camera, it is a little bigger than most small cameras including previous models (i
Unfortunately, the camera lacks some key capabilities for a camera in it's price range:No auto focus - the 3 zone focus switch found on less expensive Polaroid instant cameras should have been replaced by full auto focus
I have also had some of the digital printed and they are very nice
It is very easy to use as well
I didn't understand, but I went in Sony store, but they, only sold me a new charger
No issues in this department
$400 bucks for 3 months of use is sad
Get one today
And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord
I took closeups at a ballgame and razor sharp without a tripod
The photo quality was top notch
I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
For example, I took a picture our of a car window, and the edges of the side view mirror (integral to the picture) have lines across them
I loved the size, and feel of this Nikon
Bought the printer at the same time, but having difficulty finding a compatible cord for my Android phone or computer, so have not clue if it works yet
There's an option for 1600 and 3200, and while I use them infrequently as they're nosier, I'm glad they're an option
And another thing about stealth:10) This is a noisy camera, and there is no option to lower the volume of the beeping or turn it off
As such, the A3000 does not have a pentaprism/mirror of a traditional DSLR
very poor quality
I did tons of research and finally settled on this one with the price range I had
400$? Really? Sony is surely losing money on this camera
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
It is so easy to use, my wife doesn't have to even think about what to do
Ooops, I goofed
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
Sony is a good name so Feel fairly safe that it will fill the bill
From the prospective of the image resolution, it is nice to step up from the prior 12 MP to the new 16 MP especially for landscape photos, what allows to present more fine details and to make your pictures to look more natural than before
The zoom is fantastic
Incredible value
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
telling people over and over again to "watch your finger because the flash pops up" got really old
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
Critiques:1) Flash is in a weird spot - placed right where I would steady the camera with my non-dominant hand
Got super pictures in low light with no flash
Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather)
Owner's manual not very good, online very complex yet doesn't explain things very well
So far, so good
the HD is so TRUE [used it for almost anything] The built in mic is no good, but with external mic, you'll get an awesome video in HD
This camera has excelllent battery life
You see I never want to be caught without batteriesif ever I am in the right place at the right time with my camera at the ready
and I don't shoot much video
they were really surprising SOOC
This is a very high quality camera
i am not talking milliseconds .
It is a larger camera (not pocket) size
If you are shopping for a DSLR camera, be aware -- this is not the one
So far, my experiences have been super
I pre-ordered and have found it to be just perfect
recurring problem with battery
i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
Blueberry with Nikon S8100
The images are a little better, the camera is smaller, cheaper and a 20x zoom is still more than most people will ever need
Been taking pictures for over 30 years and needed to upgrade
I suspect they have a backlog on the the part as this appears to be a common problem
it's not my first choice in cameras,
As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
After several clips I check the battery status and it shows almost full
I thought this would be a wonderful idea for a wedding guest book but the quality of the pictures were poor and it was too small
Also keep these few things in mind based on the questions I've seen here on Amazon so far
Nikon Coolpix S8100
At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4
I also like the lens cover
Again, it exists as a second camera
The Microsoft SURFACE tablet and this Polaroid camera
It is pretty annoying and I'm thinking that pretty soon the flash is going to fall off the camera or break
For a $200 range camera, try to avoid expecting too much from zoom without a tri-pod but even still know that the picture is not going to be perfectly clear zoomed all the way to 34x
Great Point & Shoot Camera
I ordered this camera with high hopes after seeing it was the #1 selling camera on Amazon at the time of purchase, and after reading many 4-star and 5-star reviews
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
All is good with this camera except for the usb, battery and hdmi outlets
The zoom works well for static objects but not so well (in my hands) with fast moving objects
Nikon needs to get it together, not only did I waste my time, Money, but I ended up with alot of bad pictures on one of the most memorable vacation trips my mother has had
And well is a Nikon, the shots are extremely crisp and clear, very easy to use, specially in the auto mode
The lens protrudes a little, so this 'compact camera' is a bit bulkier (the lens also adds a bit of weight) than its peers, but for 10x zoom and the quality of pictures its a fair trade off
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
I'm glad I bought it
I got the red camera and I saw finger prints mine of course, but that does not bother me
You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between
turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
I went with the Nikon and couldn't be happier
This is a bit thicker than the other digital cameras, but we knew that going in
Error message of "this card cannot be read"
Well the prayers were answered because when we looked at the pictures later on a screen I could actually see, they turned out super crisp
Here are some useful facts:-
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
Need a tripod for that zoom level
The package didnt contain the leather pouch or 4GD SDHC card as promised at the checkout
That is available in &#34;P&#34;(program) mode
This is not suppose to be a high end, high resolution camera  - it is suppose to be fun, instant and a great way to have some quick pics
Noisy and grainy
These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
But the best part is the video
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
The 10x zoom is very good although I would like to have seen from a 12 to 15, but then the picture quality may have suffered
7 picture quality is excellent .
Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size
Other things:(a) contrary to the good impression many reviewers have of the Sony 18-55, I found the lens to severely lack in sharpness, especially at the borders;(b) the sensor is very nice, but a bit noisier than my 16mp Pentax K-30;(c) the camera comes with a small brochure, but you'll have to download the more comprehensive handbook from Sony's website;(d) no charger, either--you can charge the camera directly or buy a charger;(e) I found the menu fairly difficult to navigate
I bought this camera because of the large APS-C 20 MP sensor, but the 12MP sensor in the Canon T3 renders a better image
i'm really disappointed with the quality of the flash, but without it, the camera is good
The Nikon Coolpix L830 does not exactly slip into a shirt pocket but it can be completely concealed in one of my big brothers massive hands
Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera (White)
Lots of bells and whistles, but lacking in photo quality
Very good image quality/Good feature set for the price
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
I have determined that if you use this camera in flash mode, you have to remember to open the flash before you shoot by depressing the shutter halfway, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO ANYWAY TO SET THE FOCUS
proven canon built quality and lens .
Good photo quality, nice zoom
it 's no problem for me personally .
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
Love the 34x zoom, was like I was standing right next to my subject from across the auditiorium
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
It's RIGHT where your finger goes for how you would naturally hold a camera-It's really heavy for a camera, so it's difficult to just throw it in a clutch or carry it around-It's oddly shaped, and I was never able to find a camera case for itThe good:-When you do manage to get a good shot, it's a REALLY good shot-It's great outdoors-The zoom is amazingOverall, I would not recommend this camera
no needing to scan those tiny little pictures :)
Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
Being disabled I can not drive, trust me I tried driving and lets say everyone in Maryland breathed a sigh of relief when I renewed my MTA Maryland Disability Transportation Card
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
I received my Nikon quickly, well packaged and exactly as advertised
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
The preset modes can also be manipulated to produce high contrast and backlit effects, among others I have yet to fully explore
I've owned a few Nikons in the past, and am happy with this easy to use model at a pretty good price
The Canon sx superzoom series of digital cameras have consistently delivered terrific image quality in good lighting in a pocket sized camera
And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later
So yeah it feels kinda cheap and the screen on the back could be much nicer but it is perfect for capturing the family around the new baby
It's a great camera although like many new technologies it does far too many things for my purposes
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm
Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing
The good:Colours are very accurate - better than my Nex 3
The point and shoot capability is good
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
You can still look at the files through the computer, but trying to move them or view the images results in windows explorer (Not internet explorer) to crash, causing you to be stuck on your desktop
Compact and light enough to cart around when space is on budget
Will make good pictures in low light situations and in total darkness if necessary
This camera replaced an S8000 I got a little more than a year ago that has most of the identical features and it took great photos too until the lens wouldn't retract with the same "Lens Error" message
The first thing you notice is the grip
I took shots of water propulsion system in action from 1/4 mile away and they all came out great
I'm about to resell mine and get a cute, cheap point and shoot
old school
Polaroid camera, an excellent fishing sinker
This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
I wanted to be able to easily take pictures of items and upload them online
Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
That is why the instructions tell you to PUT THE STRAP ON YOUR CAMERA
Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact
Five Stars
Took 45 minutes of video and camera was still going strong
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
The main sacrifice in quality is in the LCD and EVF (electronic view finder) which have lower resolutions
What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight
The -4 to +3 5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera
There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes
But otherwise, this camera is great
The camera intrigued me because it functions both as a digital and an instant print, and the prints are pretty good quality
I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K
It is a camera for starters but it can't be compare even with an old Canon EOS T1i
Battery life fair
Save some money and buy an EOS T5i
Most digital cameras for years do not include one as the options are huge and each person has their own needs on how much storage they need (and they're cheap)
easy to use good price thanx
The LCD screen resolution doubled
It has a great zoom,has the latest Digic 6 Image Processor,shoots awesome video,and is made in Japan
It feels and looks very solid and well built
The Vivitar 1700 mAh work good but this thing eats batteries
This is not for the professional photographer
1 MP Olympus hands down
It shipped fast
It has a built in macro lens for shooting small objects/flowers/insects
This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
I thought I'd thoroughly researched replacement brands/models, and this Nikon S8100 was my best choice
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
The screen is bright and clear and the movie feature is easy to use and takes awesome video
Love Nikon
It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing
This seems like a no-brainer but but if you forget to do this, you can damage the lens mechanism
So, bottom line?  Excellent camera
Everyone loved those pictures and we were able to see things from a Cruise ship that we would have never seen otherwise
Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand
However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
The LCD screen is one of the best I have ever seen and is of high quality
I'm using a 16GB Class 10 card
mts HD format
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
Love This Camera
I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
The build quality is great
I have used this camera for 4 months, taken it on 4 trips - 1 beach, 1 cruise, 1 city, 1 nature/camping
However, with Christmas shopping upon us, I have noticed some lower prices being advertised so check around for the best price before you purchase one as a local chain store might be less expensive
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
Great camera
I love this camera
good points :
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
Good camera for the non-professional
Nikon Camera
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
Every picture turned out clear and the zoom option was nice although I didn't need it to zoom that close
I've had this camera for about two months now, and so far I would NOT recommend it
I found the menu to be clunky, and many basic features like shutter and aperture settings, manual focus (or at least a user-selected Macro mode) were either lacking entirely or buried in some menu that I couldn't find when I needed it
After a long research I think I did the BEST choice
com because was cheapper comparing with the other websites and you will receive a pretty cool case in leather for it
Both of our point and shoots suffered from being dropped and broken battery doors
3 OSS Lens for $200
However, while the lower resolution sensor on the T3 tended to mask a lot of the flaws of the lens, on the T5 and its higher resolution sensor, not so much
Replacement Camera
I was looking for a camera with a great quality in the pictures and videos, pretty color and a camera that I could put in my purse
It can just be a toy, not a digital camera
the distortion is not a flaw .
I will go on vacation in July andwill do my &#34;homework&#34; before - I promise
3 OSS Lens for $427
My wife just purchased this camera for her upcoming trip abroad,so I can't give it any more than three stars at this point as I have'nt had the chance to fully check it out,but my initial impression is that I'm very impressed with the quality
We tried to shoot various live action sports with it and it does its 5 shots in the first second or so of pushing the button, then we are stuck again for another minute, at which point if we didn't get the shot in the first 5 shots, your screwed
I don't think it's wise to provide so many shooting modes while it does not have a touch screen
Softer than the F3Previously in Auto mode, the Nex won't allow you to change shooting mode via the custom buttons; you have to go through the menu system
i love photography .
The camera seems pretty well built, this is our first nikon, we have always had milnota or kodak in the past
Focusing: yes when I zoom in and try to focus closer than the lens physically can get it won't focus (10x has to be something over 10' or so)
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
Obviously, if you're a serious photographer, this is not the camera for you, but for me, it's great
very easy to use .
This is quite a nice little camera
This camera is so much fun
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
0-Inch LCD (Black)
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
This is a great little camera
We took it on vacation with us and on the 3rd day I got a "lens error"
-The flash is in a funny spot, but i dont get upset about it
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
made the camera totally inoperable .
It is a bit on the heavy, bulky side but I don't mind it much
The camera responce is VERY quick.
With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces
The picture quality was above my expectations and my only complaint is; if it so happens a drink or any other object bumps the picture while it is printing it will cause some smearage or an inconvenient black spot or two
The zoom on it is great and zooms in very clear
No optical view finder; pictures must be framed via LCD monitor, which is extremely difficult in daylight with sun behind you
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
Also, use of monitor increases rate of battery pack depletion
My last camera was a Canon power shot
But I had to upload the directions for all the features
so far so good
it didn't feel particularly sturdy, the screen images were not crisp as I thought they should be, too many negative write-ups by people that were expert in the field (which I am not)
This is an all around great addition to the amateur photographer or as a basic family camera
LOVE THIS CAMERA
The photos were blurry no matter how hard we tried to hold it still
This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens
you can just take regular digital camera and print em at cvs or something and will have better quality photos
5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings
They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality
Bought it for a trip to Alaska and the pictures turned out amazing
Bottom line is that this camera takes exceptional pictures, but as far as its overall performance, it is trying to fill a very awkward nitch in my mind
Love this camera
Until I order that card reader, I have to use a friend's laptop which has a built in SD card reader and move files to a flash drive, and back to my computer, which is a hassle
SUCH a great camera
I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
the included memory card is too small .
I can also take multiple pictures in rapid succession
Flexible enough for most situations, large and luminous screen
I think this camera offers unparalleled value in its category
I can take pictures so much faster than before and don't have to wait to look at the picture or for it it process
The AMAZING feature about this camera is that you can take the pictures, print them for small cute wallet size instant pictures, AND save the images to your computer like a digital camera
Zoom works great and is able to focus quickly
Other than that, I love this camera.
Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors
You also have access to your photos digitally as well which is not the case with other point-shoot-print cameras
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
Well worth the money
-The pop-up flash was really inconvenient
I've read where some were having problems with blurry pictures
I got some cool pictures of Carlsbad Caverns in NM which are minimally lit
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
While it lasted, it was a great little camera
For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background
This camera has far superior clarity in still pictures compared to the Fujifilm S8200 and when filming in HD, this camera has no interlacing issues when moving the camera like the Fujifilm S8200
The T5 is lighter
It is like a little magnet gadget and has a tiny cord that holds the cap while it is off the lens
Now the Amazon guarantee is not in effect, and when returned to Nikon, they replied that this is not covered under their guarantee (surely, because this problem happens so often to their cameras that it wouldn't be worth it)
I purchased this for my wife, its really the first "better" camera we have owned
the friend lovedd ita little bulkier than expected
The camera is easy to use and has loads of features
I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
I didn't want all the different lenses to mess with
If you are shooting a lot of low-light, you may also want the T5i
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
Great pictures, not fuzzy, no distortion, even when I've zoomed it to the max
Night Photo is amazing
The camera I received was clearly the same product shown online, but I feel like I am reviewing an entirely different product than the one I expected to receive
In Manual mode the few available buttons have to pull double duty and getting everything setup takes some time
It was great, got some wonderful pictures on the oppisite side of the parade grounds
COM LIKELY THINKS I'VE GONE STARK RAVING BONKERS - I GOT THIS & THREE OTHER CAMERAS IN A WEEKS TIME
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
Well satisfied
I don't like the battery and battery charger set-up either
The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested
The whole idea behind this camera is "magazine quality images" for as little money as possible
Best Camera I Ever Had
The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon
I can't emphasize this point enough: this is one of the main reasons why I bought the camera
I was looking for an easy/solid point and shoot, and the L830 came through
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
All around a great camera for an amateur like me
Yes, it is bigger than many purely digital cameras but you have to take into consideration that it has the printer inside
There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration
More importantly, the camera suits my needs perfectly, takes great pictures
I haven't read all the instructions and have only used the automatic mode but we've been happy with the quality of the pictures
Also, with the zoom extended to the max, sometimes it takes a little time for lens to focus sharply on the object, playing with the settings for the focus area helps
I've had enough of those tiny compact cameras now and I'm never going back
Drawbacks are as follows1- The HD movie you take its only good for downloading to PC and can only be watched in low definitation with direct cble to TV (no HDMI or component cable included)
We have had it only a few weeks and love it
Great for getting a quick series shot, instead of a burst of shots (good for getting a single shot of a quick moment)
As compared to other point and shoot cameras, the quality and detail is hands down better
It replaces another Nikon camera that I dropped
This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera
Took this camera on a trip and absolutely loved the use of it in the canyons and on my favorite trails
5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera
I would like to recommend this camera to my friends
I couldnt have purchased a better one
My main issue with it is, however, the inability to connect to my computer to transport the files quickly
What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it
the camera was a marvel .
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
I can tell you that the 1080p video is amazing
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
I was able to get them back by downloading a program on my computer and reading the card separately from my camera, but my god that sucked
Nice looking camera, inexpensive, average photos
If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
Great camera that takes great pictures
I love it
However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
I love the tilt-able/extendable screen for shooting overhead or waist high photos
I just returned from a 3 week vacation to three national parks
Makes me feel like I know what I am doing
Good image quality.
The pictures are unbelievable and the videos are great
It has many features and digital video recording at 1080
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys
I am so looking forward to taking more pictures with this great camera
The quality of the instant prints are just fine
The LCD screen is low res
I had purchased rechargeables, and they lasted the rest of the two weeks in France, with power to spare
I haven't noticed any noise and have taken about 20 hours of video
It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
Best coolpix I ever had
I have been taking the best pictures EVER since I got this camera
you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
How does one know camera leaks oil?  The rotten scent emitted from oil in the chamber produces unique stinky scent, which is undeniably Nikon
Super Travel Camera for Long-Distance
If you currently shoot DSLRs, this is a good camera for when you want something light and simple to pack along with you rather than bringing all your gear
It goes everywhere and after two years is showing a little external wear
Well worth the buy
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
However, I had a few others doing the photography with me didn't have a steady hand and even though that there's an anti shake it still didn't help them
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting)
great gift
I don't think they are even in the same class so maybe this isn't a fair criticism
The pictures are kind of blurry after printing
What a difference from the typical point and shoot models
The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
If you enjoy "tweaking" settings this camera allows plenty of room to experiment
You wouldnt think it would get in the way, but i find my self often seeing the error "flash not fully raised" because my finger is blocking it
So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system
One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW
Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera
Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
System reboot after system reboot held no change, and even trying fresh on a second computer had the same issues
for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
I have been VERY HAPPY with my purchase
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
Also, I would not expect a great deal from the image stabilization
I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6
The A3000 is definitely a step forward from the smaller NEX bodies and outperforms them in some aspects including response
(BTW - Vivatar makes cheap higher capacity batteries for this camera I later discovered) Overall, this camera is large for a pocket camera and fairly heavy but it is packed with features and a great zoom that honestly is at the limit of being functional at full zoom (30x max zoom requires bracing your arms to stay on target)
Sometimes it comes on and won't even show anything on the screen
Pictures are very low quality
I bought it very cheap from AMAZON
This also has some bearing on the night or low light pictures taken with the S8100
Takes great pictures -- I just need to learn and practice more
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
Problem continued; contacted Nikon at about day 110
By bumping down to 2048x1536 you can dramatically speed this up to 5 sec, and you can get a really quick cycling by using the tiny 640x480 resolution
We have already tried the camera out, and it truly is an amazing camera with clear photos
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with
The sound could be a bit better, but it's certainly not bad enough to complain
You simply cannot beat the value of this camera and lens combination for the money
When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
Like it
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
No Zoom Noise whilre Recording Video, Fantastic Purchase
If you play around with the settings a little bit you find out what works best
The second big difference is the battery
And re the view finder, or the flat screen on the back, if you find these a problem, you never worked in the old days where all we had was a ground glass viewer
Not sure how much video space that is as I have not taken any video yet (therefore have not rated the video in this review)
after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor
Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC
I was hoping it might be 75% as good but sadly it's more like 25% in our indoor photos
This camera that takes high resolution pictures, vivid colors, is reasonably priced
I was excited to get a 20 mp camera, thinking it would be even better than my Sony 8 mp 150, but it does not even come close in quality pictures or ease of use
It takes great pictures and I love the 30x optical zoom
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
The printing time for the picture isn't long at all usually a few seconds and ta-dah you have a printed picture
The first thing you notice is the grip
My camera focus's by itself
Guess Nikon hasn't figured out how to make a good  10x zoom lens weigh less than a  gram, darn those guys
It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light
Then every time I connected my camera to my computer via the USB cable provided, it claims that the USB port is not a USB 2
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
Beyond the flickering, I felt the camera simply took poor photos compared to other cameras I have had, even those with 1/4 to 1/2 the resolution of this one
Thank you Santa!
it appears it would survive a truck driving over it
I thought little of it, and tried to reinstall the drivers through the device's preferences, but found that the option was unavailable for some reason
Long battery life for still shots, short battery life for video
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
I bought this camera at amazon
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
Designing the pop up flash on the left side of the camera you're the user tends to hold the camera, does not quite make sense to me; however, this was not a deal breaker to purchasing this camera
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
I've gotten used to grainy pictures in dimily lit rooms (and ironically this camera does a wonderful job at improving that, so that it's usually a non-issue
This camera has it ALL and more
Great camera that I`ve ever seen
Totally true
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
It is attractive and well designed
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting
This is NOT your father's/grandfather's camera/camera company
I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
The menu is very intuitive and user friendly
I also like the fact it has a HDMI port
this camera will stay with me for years !
The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
Love it
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well
I'll keep searching or wait for a similar upcoming product to come out
The flash quality is good too
The photos are just breathtaking and better than anything I've ever seen or was able to accomplish with any other camera
Too many of those advertised on amazon
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
I suggest reading the manual and learning as much as you can about the settings it does have
And with the fact you can use interchangeable lenses you can really start to do some amazing things with your video
It's light but it's solid with a nice rest for my thumb
battery seems to last long so far
There were certain features I knew I wanted but didn't know if I could get them all in the same camera
I have a 50x zoom camera also-but I tend to use this one most of the time-because I can stick it in my purse or pocket-which I can't do with my other one
Remarkable low-light performance
The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
Poor experience overall
The new SX700 also introduces an interesting feature - Zoom Framing Assist, which should help with composing shots of far distant subjects
Low light shots were surprisingly clear and sharp as well
The image quality and price both align to this middle of the spectrum range, and for a 20MP APS-C sensor this is a great value
I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
So far a GOOD solid VERY SMALL (for 10x) Zoom Auto Point and Shoot - But doesn't over come the laws of physics
The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
I was also perplexed at the menu manipulation and understanding what the camera was telling me it could do
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
The NEX 7 is a must have
It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject
great job canon !
It's simple and basic, point shoot view
You get the same 18-55 IS II lens that came with the T3
I really like this camera - for the price it's a good value
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
It couldnt even do good recognition sometimes leaving the pictures blurry
I bought this camera because of the large APS-C 20 MP sensor, but the 12MP sensor in the Canon T3 renders a better image
I mainly bought the camera for its zoom and it hasn't failed me yet
The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
I compare the Canon and sony cameras with S8100 and I can say that this is a clean win for Nikon
But can't seem to pick it up without pushing one of them silly bottoms
Sure, it has a few things that could be better (more control over continuous burst speed, slow down the shot speed on the 16 shot mode, better video setting controls, maybe put the flash 1/4 of an inch to over) but if they fixed all that, it would probably sell for 400 bucks
I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
The printed pictures are quite small and the quality is not that good
Now the best part of this camera is the 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor
I am used to pulling out my camera, hitting the on button and shooting quickly
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
The image quality is not good at all if there is any kind of motion in the picture
I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
According to dpreview
This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this
"meh" interface
Camera takes very nice photos
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
I really prefer having the  option of having both
The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio
This camera does great with the flash off of grabbing the image better and with more detail than you can see with your eyes
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
camera
The continuous auto-focus while recording an HD video is a highly useful feature when the subject is a constantly moving 14 months kid
;)
The basic 18-55 lens is great for your daily pictures plus you have the option of getting different purpose lens as well
All of the shots are very awesome
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
Having said that, it by no means feels rugged
While I like the camera very much, it still has the problem of the battery blinking during video taking
I recommend it for someone wanting a simple to use camera, great pics, low light, 10x zoom and stereo 1080p video
Very good camera for casual shooting
For a camera in its class it does a great job with both of the features I mentioned just know it is simply not going to have the abilities of a camera like say the Canon EOS Rebel T3i or above
Nice camera
Video is sharp although I have not used it extensively yet
shutter sound5
Comes with multiple settings already programed and easy enough to play with other settings
All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
I am so pumped to give this to my girlfriend for her birthday
I recommend this camera to anyone
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
This is probably due to the actual number of lenses and distance the lenses are able to extend from the camera itself
Also, it uses a high powered light to gauge the target apparently, so it's not stealthy
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2
comparison between L830 and predecesor L820
I like the idea of the camera (the printing is pretty awesome, if you can take a picture clear enough to be worth printing) more than the camera itself
NOT even 1080 x 800 resolution
This camera exceeded all of my expectations
I can share images and video easily to my phone
The continuous auto-focus while recording an HD video is a highly useful feature when the subject is a constantly moving 14 months kid
You will be getting good use from them with this camera
cameras capture moments .
Why Nikon didn't include a stand a lone charger with this camera is beyond me
My six year old point and shoot camera gives better quality photos and a better screen than this camera
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
Thank you
The zoom is fabulous, and most of the time, I didn't have problems with blurry zoomed photos
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
it is larger then you think trust me but on a good note it does exactly what they said and it does it's job well
Excellent camera
Has a separate button for movies; hence you can take a movie, then a photo, then a movie, etc
8 battery life is excellent .
2) Battery life not so good when printing multiples
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
I added a memory card and can switch from internal to external memory depending on my memory needs
I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus
takes excellent photos .
(the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery)
I will informed all my family and my friends, so they will get one
It feels just wonderful in my hands as the grip is perfect even though my hands are small
Weight: yes it weighs a little more but feels solid
The consumer wins big time on the A3000
Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
Auto Scene works OK so far otherwise
" When I printed the photo, the colours were washed out, the text on the border was cut off so I could only see 1/3 of it, and the entire image was pixelated
I highly recommend this model
The first was the L810, I didn't like that one because my images were getting scrambled when i used the review function so I was pissed but decided to give Nikon a second chance and bought the S8100
It wastes storage space in the SD card
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
I mention the settings I have changed because it seems like people complaining about fuzzy images simply do not know how to use even a basic point and shoot camera
Excellent Pictures
Thanks for the input on the past gens that helped my purchase decision
In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise
The zoom is amazing
