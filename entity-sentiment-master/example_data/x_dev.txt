This is the first Nikon camera I've bought - as I have owned a digital sony and cannon in the past
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
The problem is
Too many of those advertised on amazon
I have only had it a couple days but I love it
Some time in this process the camera got scratched and glare spots appeared on pictures where light hit the lens
First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well
I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
- Even though its larger and heavier than its predecessors, its still much lighter than an equivalent DSLR
The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
pogo polaroid instant photos for art journaling/scrapbooking/travel journaling
Just about anyone should love this
I love this Polaroid it was everything I wanted
Nikon L830 Great Camera
The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
I shot over 850 images meticulously testing settings and options in numerous situations and ended up with three pictures I thought were really good
one i really like is the &#34;single color&#34; mode where you can take a photo of a person wearing a ball cap, and make the ball cap the only thing in color with the rest of the photo in BW
It had more uses than I expected so I'm still learning
The Cannon was OK but lacked some of the items of interest
Great little camera
I've gotten used to grainy pictures in dimily lit rooms (and ironically this camera does a wonderful job at improving that, so that it's usually a non-issue
It works great and I don't have to carry extra len's and equipment like I do when i use my Canon 70D
But when we're LOOKING at a beautiful photo taken with (for instance) this camera's wide-angle lens, we're using our central vision to view the photo
Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip
You can't really get much better than this for a quality point and shoot camera, and the price is reasonable
Inside the house the differences could be seen especially in lower light
the picturers are amazing .
The LCD screen is amazing
Great Camera
Five Stars
Nikon S8100 P&S Camera
I read about it in the NYTimes, which made it sound like manna from heaven
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
Not an Expert, But an Enthusiast
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
3- USB kicks!
(And that was the narrowed part)The Olympus had all the right specs
Overall, though, has the best pictures so far in a compact camera with good zoom as of May 2014
I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
Solid build like a mini-SLR
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
We leave for my nieces wedding in Ireland in August
I would be reluctant to buy a camera anyplace else
Quick to turn on and take a picture or just a moment pause before starting video capture
Sorry Nikon, going back to canon brand
I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen
com, search for "Kodak photography books" or any book you think you may need
It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it &#34;repaired&#34; not knowing what happened
Grear
Whenever I leave the house, it is in is case on my belt, ready for use
Image quality is very good IMO
My beef with this camera started the very first time I turned it on
The camera is so smart - is has a "Smile" feature that only when the subjects are smiling will it take
There was also noise coming from the camera when in zoom
The zoom is nice
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
Recommend a SD card with at least a class 4 rating (the 1080p is a a lot of data to write)
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
For the past week, I've been reading the manual from cover to cover both learning what this camera can do along with deciphering all the technical lingo
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
However I did not want just any camera that used AA Battery power
The VIDEO EDITING  software that comes with it is very good
As I see it the benefits are:(1) Small size--small enough to fit, in the case, in a large pocket, or out of the case, in a much smaller one
Good zoom I'm happy
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
Great little inexpensive camera
Even the burst shots, HDR and the lowlight shots are quick, you dont even notice how many shots the camera has taken until they process and merge for the final product
I would recommend this camera to folks of all ages
For my long overseas travel, the GPS function is actually essential
(Now 1 star- see update)First, there is no remote shutter release system available for this camera
An A++!!!
Great camera with super zoom ability
I highly recommend this product for the price
unfortunately we are no longer able to return the product but want to let people know that it is of poor quality
They all came out superb
Great camera
5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
It makes a great photo printer for pictures taken with other cameras
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
Uploading them to the computer is a breeze too
I know Nikon has a reputation for doing better in low light; I found that wasn't the case unless I used the night setting or museum (too slow for children)
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
I have no doubt that I could get a good shot with a tripod, but it's usually not possible to bring a tripod and claim the aisle at these kind of events
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
The zoom really is incredible in this camera
i do know the zoom lens is very good
Obviously this only works up to a point
I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know my way around a camera
There are numerous features and the menu system can be a little daunting, but I tend not to get carried away with all of those special scene features
This camera is it
Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
You simply cannot beat the value of this camera and lens combination for the money
If you play around with the settings a little bit you find out what works best
My Yongnuo-560II cannot fit in because of the big built-in flash housing next to the hot shoe
the best camera i have bought
My complaints are that the menu system is not very organized, the print quality is not what was expected (based on type of paper too) and there is no way to reverse printing
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
Both cameras are excellent in low light without a flash,  but in this scenario I think the Fuji has slighlty less noise and a teensy bit better color saturation
I was greeted by a persistent and distracting screen flicker that I have not seen in any other camera
This is a beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
My biggest problem was the printing
It takes great pictures
-Sometimes it takes a while focus when its in AUTO mode (only during lower light conditions)
Great quality
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
The zoom is wonderful and for the landscape pictures I take, it is great
Does well in good light situations
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
i'm really disappointed with the quality of the flash, but without it, the camera is good
The macro took great pictures of flowers and the detail was awesome
5cm (1 in)
It does very well with totally automatic as well with aperture and time control
Plus the zoom is smooth and is great when trying to bring in that wildlife that is far off in the distance
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
the g2 was better in this respect .
It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies
Bought it for a trip to Alaska and the pictures turned out amazing
Owner's manual not very good, online very complex yet doesn't explain things very well
i love photography .
It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
And the zoom is incredible
The camera would work with internal memory - but would not work with a memory card of any sort or size installed
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
we were looking forward to many holiday pictures so what a bummer that was
do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
That zoom is amazing
Nikon needs to get it together, not only did I waste my time, Money, but I ended up with alot of bad pictures on one of the most memorable vacation trips my mother has had
Great camera
I wish I could give this product five stars
Great Shots for less Money
Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience
SUCH a great camera
That being said, let's look at the FZ70
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
I have been using my new camera to photograph action scenes of my new invention, The FlashBak Rear bike light
Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
Takes great pictures -- I just need to learn and practice more
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
Image quality is superb and one will love it
Great point-and-shoot with simple to use options
It's just another camera
Even when only zooming out 20x - 30x, far from the extreme limit of the camera, I didn't get one picture I bothered to keep out of well over 150 tries
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
This camera has excelllent battery life
An awesome camera for the price
And 120x digital zoom
I can tell you that the 1080p video is amazing
It is digital but also can switch to the view finder with ease and takes great pictures
The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
The manual is huge, since there are so many capabilities of this camera
I did pull several pics off my computer and loaded them on an Sd card for printing
Takes nice, crisp photos with vivid color
Great little camera
For years, I've debated what camera to take birding
I will upload some images when I shoot more with it
Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
What I like about the Fuji and the Sony, though is that they are small enough to fit in a purse - whereas this Panasonic most definitely is not
the distortion is not a flaw .
JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
The camera takes great night pictures - I have had great luck at concerts and outdoors with the Night Landscape (more so than the Night Portrait which uses flash)
Battery life is good
Also, the burst shooting is a joke
Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked
After my grand daughter dropped and broke the lens and telescope, I put it away and just used my phone for the past year
I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the photographs
Not very high quality images
I suspect that the problem lies in the difference between CCD and CMOS sensors, although the FZ 47 was a CCD model and it was no better and much worse than the FZ 40
I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like
I think this is the bergain of the century
Anyway, it's really nice quality and very durable
It doesn't explain the different modes at
ok a Christmas present for my wife (wink) and its awesome so far
I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens
This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras
The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide
I ordered this camera about 6 months ago
with fabulous features
The 60X optical zoom produces fuzzy unusable pictures at the high end of the zoom
So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken
S8100 is a winner
So far so good
A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording, now on the top of the camera
Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000
Zoom brings the subject right to you
So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding
We bought this camera to replace our three year old one
T3 is best for still shots and is cheaper, has more battery life
If you aren't overly concerned with printing pictures of larger size this camera will fit your needs
It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen
Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are
I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera
I just need something that works
Definitely not worth the $$$
I kept going back and reading directions and trying different settings
However, the manual says you cannot change the zoom while taking video, so I want to verify that and make sure the focus keeps up
Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing
This is about the 20th digital camera I've purchased, and other than the rugged pentax optio that I bought a couple of years ago, this is the ONLY ONE that does not have an ORIENTATION SENSOR
Good price
Meh
Great in low light
Excellent camera
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate
As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
The camera would not turn off or retract the lends
Not bad at all
I was looking for new camera that took nice close-ups of family as well as my crafts
This old school camera is perfect for preserving memories and instant prints
Absolutely
Lens quality is amazing and a nice wide angle minimum focal length
Aside from that it is definitely worth the money
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
I will go on vacation in July andwill do my &#34;homework&#34; before - I promise
These features are nice to have but really not necessary features for the beginner or someone like myself with other cameras0
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
I love it
Cool camera
Multi-mode IS does well for low-light (less shake in the results)* Good results (in auto or "P" modes) with high-contrast shots like shooting directly into sunlight
It feels good and solid
This is the best entry level APS-C camera you can buy at this price
Couldn't be happier
Nikon coolpix has some nice desired features and is easy to use
Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
Its very bulky, which i guess isnt to bad because it does print pictures instantly
I contacted Panasonic and was not happy with the response
Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder
All things considered I would definitely recommend this camera
A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light
The flash quality is such that I am not going to complain about where it's located
And then finally on that dial there is the magic M and that is manual mode and that's where you get to set the shutter speed and aperture for yourself
I am very pleased with this camera
However, this was my first camera without a viewfinder, and after two weeks, I returned it and ordered the Panasonic Lumix FZ60 - a more expensive camera; but, with viewfinder
Great "Multipurpose" and  Small Digital Camera
So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes
The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
The menu is very intuitive and user friendly
Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
I have never had a Coolpix before, so I'm in the early learning stages with it
This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
A Beginners Dream Camera
as of now I'll never go back
I'm totally impressed with this Lumix
took it to Christmas brunch and now on our way to dinner
The issue is with the audio
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
The self timer and smile timer are great when you want a family shot without having to ask people to take your picture
It's a great step up from you basic point and shoot and from the L820 that we had purchased earlier
It makes you look like a PRO Videographer
As of this writing I have only had the camera for about three weeks
For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
The SX700 has an incredible 30x optical zoom ranging from true wide angle at 25mm (full frame equiv)  to 750mm telephoto (full frame equiv)
This camera is huge
Minor cosmetic flaw that does not affect the performance of this great digi cam
Figure out if your needs are what this camera can give you, because I am thoroughly happy with mine and will be giving one to my cousin now that the price has gone down
I like the ease of selecting the shooting mode, switching between the various menus, and the playback mode is similar to my old Canon
Truly Impressive and an Exceptional Buy
Great Compact Camera
I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
The Nikon Coolpix L830 is no where near as noisey as my Pentax K5 or K30 even if they take batter pictures
And the HD video (720p) is very good for a camera of this size
In a nutshell, if you are intent on increasing your range & don't overly care to concern yourself w/manual settings, as well as comparing the intuitive interface, the tilting LCD screen, and most of all, the image quality to the Canon SX510 & other megazooms, I am rather confident believing there is no better camera out there anywhere at this $196 price point
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the film is not readily available
You can't tell that it takes two pictures because it all only takes the time of a normal flash picture
As such, the A3000 does not have a pentaprism/mirror of a traditional DSLR
its size is smaller and good for travel
I want to make sure I get tons of great pictures
Then, only a few months later, it just stopped working
I  shot some video in the same dim light and objects near the light source are great
I was considering getting the Nikon 520 due to it's slightly higher resolution but got this instead because of the much longer focal length zoom
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
But I quickly got used to it and trained myself to place my hand elsewhere
I have ac delco batts in the camera now
I should get some amazing nature pictures
ISO 400 and 800 work very well: 400 is especially sharp
Three Stars
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
The best camera I ever own
mts HD format
I took many good pictures -  sharp and clean, with nice colors
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
This camera did not live up to my expectations
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
Ive been using an Olympus for the past 3yrs and love it
The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses
Light, very light
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
(6) Perhaps a bit overzealous on the noise correction
It was great
Yes, it is bigger than many purely digital cameras but you have to take into consideration that it has the printer inside
This is not a SLR camera
I bought this camera for my wife and she's loving it
I have been taking a lot of nice pictures and I'm improving every time
Zoom works great and is able to focus quickly
The point and shoot capability is good
This camera does almost everything I want in a new camera
I'm not crazy about Nikon not supplying a battery charger, instead you charge the battery in the camera with the usb cord
positives
which slows down the speedThe most unacceptable issue of this camera, is the image quality it provides
I added on another zoom lens that attaches right to the front of the existing lense, with no adapters or anything needed, and now I have over 100X zoom on a compact digital camera
- MANUAL FLASH SELECTION: Not only must you pop up the flash manually, but it's a tiny, inconvenient switch on the side where your hand will never naturally land
And with the fact you can use interchangeable lenses you can really start to do some amazing things with your video
" When I printed the photo, the colours were washed out, the text on the border was cut off so I could only see 1/3 of it, and the entire image was pixelated
excellent pictures and video
I bought this camera about 6 months ago to have something more portable then my D-SLR, and it has went beyond my expectations for a point and shoot camera
The only reason it didn't get a 5th star is because of the camera software inside
This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
The images are not at all noise-free: it is ridiculous to market them as such
You can just not zoom, and lock the AF to fix this problem
I have used many digital cameras.
WOW! Big difference!
I&#8217;m not sure Sony&#8217;s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently
Last month my 2 year old t3 stopped working and displayed an error 20 on the screen
The camera has very good image stabilization which is essential for shooting at slower shutter speeds especially at longer telephoto settings
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
After hours of research I had high hopes for this camera
Poor quality photos even with the more expensive photo paper
For years I only used my pocket Sony Cyber - shot
Great Camera
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
Even Duracells are only durable for 300-500 shots
Nikon Coolpix L830 - Great Camera for the Price
lens is attached so no head for changes lens
telling people over and over again to "watch your finger because the flash pops up" got really old
However, it is a waste of time to go through those modes by just using the stiff buttons
They also slowed the zoom speed down (to reduce noise?)
overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between
I liked it because I was able to make more than one copy, edit it as well as change the setting
Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
FYI: I've read reviews that some were able to pseudo-compensate via manual controls, but when the moment is there, you want to capture it quick
Now as to the camera itself
In the photo, you can actually see the oven and refrigerator and even read the clock on the oven and microwave
The flash really drains the battery life quickly
A great value, I have had 3 other point and shot cameras( 2 Fuji,1 cannon) this one is the best
However, it was not so in my case.
She is very familiar with various cameras since she has been very much into photography for the last 15 years
If you do a lot of video, the T5i would be better
Takes great pictures for the price
I will update this as I use the camera more
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
My husband needed a camera that corrected for shake, and so far, this one is impressive
Video clips don't always load to my media player
The continuous auto-focus while recording an HD video is a highly useful feature when the subject is a constantly moving 14 months kid
I put in an unused card I had in my desk drawer and it worked after some fiddling in the menu
This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
I was excited to get a 20 mp camera, thinking it would be even better than my Sony 8 mp 150, but it does not even come close in quality pictures or ease of use
Sure, a DSLR (who's lens would cost more than this camera
The menus also offer a great set of tips to help new users understand even the more advanced features
I thought I would like the extra zoom on the FZ70
camera readily available from local pawn shop?Unlike 30 year old Kodak, this Nikon junk probably leaks oil, but sensor is so tiny, hardly any oil lands in the sensor area
It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses
I was replacing my Canon SD1000, which I loved
The low light image quality is far better than all other point n shoot cameras and significantly better than those &#34;fit in the jeans pocket&#34; cameras
I have just played with it, learning to use it, so far it has been great, suggest a tripod for the extra long zoom shots
I didn't want to force it in, so I tried to power down and back up, but nothing I tried fixed the lens error
I need someone's help with this camera when I do shots at a basketball game I'm not sure of all the settings yet, can someone help I took a lot of pictures (outdoors ) but need help inside
The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
I highly recommend this camera
Mine is still fine and I've taken thousands of photos and some video
Cameras battery only lasted for a few minutes untill you had to recharge
7) There is no battery bar on the screen nor in the menu, I've yet to see it after using this cam many times
I am more than happy with this camera
Nikon Coolpix L830 Diugital Camera
I am looking for another megazoom; it will probably be a Canon
(I have owned many canons and a panasonic lumix
The lens gets a little soft in the long end
"the lightweight alternative"
Trying to fill a novelty niche, but falls horribly short
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
It wasn't hard to do, even for a non-techie
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
Also, the fact that the flash was right under where you would put your fingers, made it longer to take pictures because sometimes the flash would pop out under the fingers and you would have to do a double take
The strap, which is also included, helps this camera to feel nice and secure around my neck
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
The continuous shots I took were a little blurry, but I think with some practice, this may improve
The form fit of the SX700 is a little bit bigger but offers some advance features that make the size increase very worthwhile
The image quality is superb
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has meet all the promises
Hopefully Polaroid will improve it in future versions
I took the camera into Best Buy to find a camera bag for it
Friends and family have been amazed at the quality of the photos taken with this camera
The thing that drives me crazy is that i can't contact the seller so i can request return
It was as if the camera was constantly seeking focus
this camera performs like i can not believe !
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
I thought I might miss a digital viewfinder but discovered that, with the brightness turned up on the LCD, the viewfinder was quite useable in bright sunlight and the view is stunning in hi resolution
love this camera
I also can't notice much effect using their stabilization system
I do not see that many pixels on the photos, it is so frustrating
The long zoom is also a big plus when taking wildlife shots
Well worth the cost
I highly recommend it
can use hot shoe6
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
Totally true
And there is no lens hood
I write this review with mixed feelings
I have never used a Panasonic camera before and I really like the looks and the high quality feel of this
I really prefer having the  option of having both
IT IS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I AM USE TO, BUT I REALLY LIKE IT
First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor
Low light shots were surprisingly clear and sharp as well
I love it and the fact that the photos have an easy peel back making it fun for collage boards
Pictures come out vertu nice and crisp
Top Camera
The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations
that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos
I took over 400 pictures at the wedding and I cannot say enough good things about this camera
Its functionality in indoor light situations is much better than my previous Lumix cameras
Takes great pictures
that u missed in the mirror!
Best all purpose camera with an affordable price
The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line
I use this on a daily purpose for work but would not like to have it for personal use
At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly
I also find using AA batteries easier and less expensive than proprietary batteries
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind
I suspect they have a backlog on the the part as this appears to be a common problem
I have also had some of the digital printed and they are very nice
The best compact zoom camera
However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion
the panorama photos are flawlessly stitched and consistent due in part to the Panorama 5 software that comes with the camera
I don't mind the flash position that everyone seems to dislike
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
While manual settings will give the best results, the auto settings were pretty intelligent
As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
A wonderful camera
But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box
I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
I'm a very occasional photographer, so this camera meets my needs very well
The Nikon Coolpix l830 is awesome, we have been having fun with this camera
I'm not going to bore you with repeating statistics and features many contributors do
I use this camera as an alternative to carrying my DSLR
Great zoom camera
I'm really upset about that
Love the 30X zoom
All in all it does allow low light photos
This camera does great with the flash off of grabbing the image better and with more detail than you can see with your eyes
this camera is amaizing , very easy to use and the 60x zoom is wonderfull i need more time for review the many options to use
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
The only thing I absolutely do not like is the flash
A great birding camera
In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera
I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
That's why I took it back
I find it easy to operate
Slow camera also
For me, that is a huge bonus
If i want manual control, it's there
I tested it by taking a flash-free picture of my kitchen at night with all of the lights in the house off
It was time to upgrade
I liked the sticker effect of the Polaroid, just wish it was better or a cheaper price
It also provides lots of shooting modes
It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use
Easy to use and easy to transfer pictures to your PC
What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it
It's not very heavy and really it's not too thick, it's about the length of your thumb (unless you have really, really big thumbs)
It has average shooting performance, slower than other cameras in the Panasonic line, not at all blazing fast
the nikon 's are great cameras .
I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod
We took this great little camera on a trip to Mexico not long ago and it was awesome
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
the moveable lcd screen is great .
Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
I dropped my Canon Powershot S80 & got this to replace it
I am not a professional photographer and am still trying to figure out some of the features on the camera
I bought this camera because of the large APS-C 20 MP sensor, but the 12MP sensor in the Canon T3 renders a better image
Hope this helps thanks for reading this wall of text
Pictures and video look very good, better than my other cameras
I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers
Raw files from this camera provide a lot of flexibility for post processing
It's  my  4th Lumix
What else can I say?
BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT THE FLASH
The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
Reasonable size (fits in pocket)
The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
So easy to use that even I managed to get some spectacular photos
Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer
I guess I just need to spend more money if I want a camera that will take pictures of fast movement
I only shoot with Panasonic, video or photo and have never had a problem
After a few uses, you'll figure out exactly where you need to place our index finger so it does not infer with the flash
I also like the slightly raised Video button and its location
Come to think of it, all photo software from camera manufacturers is lousy
It doesn't provide as detailed a view as some of the higher resolution screens on the T5i and 70d but it is equally viewable in direct sunlight
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper
and you have to connect it to the camera to charge battery, not take battery out
No high-speed-shutter scene mode
Great camera
This is a great camera for users who want to use long focal length for wildlife and don't want to spend money for a huge, heavy and expensive DSLR lens
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
However, if the shallow grip doesn't bother you and you want the newer kit lens plus the touch screen, by all means, get the Rebel SL1
The internal memory seems to be defective which makes it go wacky
I waited for the next Panasonic, even while other powerful zooms made their appearance, because I had a hunch it would be worthwhile to do so
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
, without going through menu
Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels
You cant even film at night time
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
Bought it as a gift
I believe that was due to my inexperience with the camera
I like the RED body although it shows fingerprints more than a black camera
Many of my birding friends who have them
The tech seem surprised when I told her nothing happened
I really liked it and was finally getting into to the point where I could switch back and forth between settings, and could anticipate what setting I'd need for the best picture
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
Zoom is awesome
It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and the controls & setup are easy to navigate
either bad lighting, too grainy, and the biggest problem, terrible color balance
We took it on vacation and then found you have to look at the monitor on the back to frame the shot
I have not taken many videos yet, but it looks nice so far
However, while the lower resolution sensor on the T3 tended to mask a lot of the flaws of the lens, on the T5 and its higher resolution sensor, not so much
First of all, the plastic this camera made from feels so cheap
The zoom is wonderful
Low light still pictures with no zoom are your best bet for a good shot
I am sure there are other features, video for example, that are better in the new models
okay
-- lousy content aside, the videos turn out great
On the other hand, I took a video of approximately 8 minutes in duration with the Vivitar 1700 mAh batteries without seeing a low battery warning, although the camera got pretty hot in the process
After researching the Sony A3000, I was really shocked to find it at the price I bought it for
Uses real batteries
there is zero stability control so you have to have very steady hands
I researched hybrid all-in-ones for weeks and finally settled on this model - for the money there is none better
I can still put the camera in my pocket without too much bulk
When I hold the camera, my thump seems to always touch that button, will have to work on different thumb placement
Writing in continuous mode can be very slow, and you can't shoot again until it's done--the wait is about 12 seconds at the highest resolution
This is a GREAT hybrid camera for the price
I love this camara, it is amazing what you can do with it and its zoom is awsome
We ordered this product through Amazon but I think they fulfilled the order via third party
The printing does work, but as others have mentioned, the printing function kills the battery
It takes good pictures, but when recording video, it goes out of focus as soon as the focus is moving (in or out), and in a lot of cases it will not regain focus, the service department has giving me excuses and do not admit that the camera has a problem, that's why I recomend to check more reviews in regards of video before buying it, if you just want to take pictures, get a cheaper camera with the same capabilities as this one, you'll save alot
Something I have discovered that I do like
Those are my three main reasons why these canon cameras are the BEST for new photographers and even videographers nowadays
Great camera
I has a Cannon One Shot prior to the Coolpix that got stolen
I had some difficulty with the panoramic pictures
In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you
If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
I'd say that this camera is perfect.
I would like to see future models have WIFI and viewer for your eye
I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels
this IS the one
I would give it 5 stars but the flash is right where I would normally put my left hand when holding it so you have to adjust how you hold it so that the flash can pop up
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera
The wide 20mm lens helps, as does the f2
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
Insert sd card and choose the prints you want to print
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments
I love the zoom
The camera has significant focusing issues while shooting video especially if you go from a bright area to a shaded area of vice versa
You will need to brace properly or use a tripod for best results, but in a pinch, handheld can be done, the OIS works well
So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000
great shots, zoom is great, and nice to handle
Pros:- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?- Small enough to keep with me
I like the idea of the camera (the printing is pretty awesome, if you can take a picture clear enough to be worth printing) more than the camera itself
Control layout is largely unchanged and remains pretty straight-forward to operate
We were looking at purchasing the S9000 camera, but this one had better reviews and now I know why
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
had it for a week .
Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies
Not sure this is the camera for me,
I loved the size, and feel of this Nikon
Noisy and grainy
The camera I received was clearly the same product shown online, but I feel like I am reviewing an entirely different product than the one I expected to receive
Feels good in your hand and easy to handle
The camera  failed in ways that have been documented about the 280 elsewhere (see Amazon reviews and the Canon forums)
All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
No can do with this camera
For $300 you'd think that the camera would last longer
5 x 11, and the printed pictures came out extremely clear
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
This resulted in "red" pictures as the shutter fired while the flash, impeded by my finger, only popped up part way and so didn't actually illuminate anything
Need a tripod for that zoom level
When my wife returns I will be able to give an update response so stay tuned
I've got a couple of digital cameras.
The reason I gave it 4 stars is night shooting isn't what I would like it to be, the camera case sometimes opens up on the top, and the battery is very poor even more so if for any reason you use the flash I highly recommend getting a backup battery for it
i use this as a second camera
While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't
Nothing Special
Really love it
My wife just purchased this camera for her upcoming trip abroad,so I can't give it any more than three stars at this point as I have'nt had the chance to fully check it out,but my initial impression is that I'm very impressed with the quality
The Nikon Coolpix L830 does not exactly slip into a shirt pocket but it can be completely concealed in one of my big brothers massive hands
Five Stars
anybody can explain that ?
Horrible
While I like the camera very much, it still has the problem of the battery blinking during video taking
It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback)
The zoom  brings the picture right to you
They are crisp and clear, and the color is beautiful
I purchased this for my wife, its really the first "better" camera we have owned
stabilization works great to reduce blur
Unfortunately I thought it was a viewfinder camera and it is not
Speckeled noise is much more visible in lower light areas
It's small, digital and you can decide which pictures you want to print, which is awesome in case you take a bad picture
I've only been playing with it for a few minutes now and I already like it a lot
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
Im still researching a way to print items that were not generated by the camera, but this thing would be that much more valuable if it could be 'just' a printer
The real deal is when you look at the pictures, when you send them to print
In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise
Attention to detail lacking
Best Camera I've ever owned
The telephoto lens gave me incredible, clear pictures and using the built in editing feature allowed me to make changes before I downloaded the pictures onto my computer when I got home
The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
I like the fact that I can just plug the camera into the charger instead of removing the battery all the time
its continuous shooting mode
First, I must state that I have NOT purchased this camera
Don't care how good the pictures are when you use the camera in the sun
Very good camera
But it was quick and easy
I'm not sorry I purchased it however, I suspect I will only use it a few times a year
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all
All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
I do not like the position of the button to video
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
The zoom works well for static objects but not so well (in my hands) with fast moving objects
, 2)the camera is more bulky than I would have liked
I would rather buy a nice camera and take the time to have it printed
nice quality
My biggest issue is limp flash
i am quite happy with the camera .
So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments
Nice camera
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
Long story short - I am supremely happy that I bought this camera
easy navigate menu8
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
Best coolpix I ever had
I had read the reviews for this camera on several websites and the only negative thing I read about was the zoom sound in videos
Also took lots of night shots in France, and they were also great
My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom
The backlighting feature and the night shot feature is AWESOME
Super photos on a recent trip
Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX
In previous cameras I have owned the battery has lasted much longer
And the color of picture is not as beautiful as sony
Such A Small Package
Awesome Price for a Great Camera
In fact I am still trying to figure out how to change the f
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
It's a great idea for fun with your kids
So easy to use
You cannot go wrong with a Nikon
Highly recommend
The video resolution on the T5 is better than the T3 and there is an auto-contrast detection
While I mainly bought this camera for its photo capabilities, there is no denying that this little guy makes fantastic videos
This explains why I can say I traveled to at least 15 stores over several months to demonstrate, test and fondle, easily, 50 cameras
I have used this camera for both photos and video recording
I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do
Hard to move and feels like it will break easily
this is not a handbag camera .
The first time this happened, i was very tempted to take it back
This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still
)or far away
There are lots of options on the camera, but the instruction manual that comes packaged with it is totally useless, only shows you how to work the basic function to take pictures, so I had to experiment with the different settings to find what works best
My favorite is the &#34;hand held twilight&#34; mode - perfect for getting shots without a flash, just make sure your subjects holds steady
The camera itself is about as good as my cell phone and the colors look a little off
Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive
I've taken several videos with it and it was simple to do
It feels very sturdy in my hand
With regard to the camera,its a complete disappointment
I went with the Nikon and couldn't be happier
Light weight great zoom no changing lenses
This year I was ahead of the game, I ordered right after Thanksgiving and I received it 2 days later
This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options
Super handy and great quality
great camera .
If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it
An outstanding camera at an excellent price
I like a mix of AUTO and manual - this one has it, and manual is extremely easy to call up and use, unlike that mode for the other two brands
raw, this still won't touch a dslr BUT this probably has the best looking point and shoot photos i've seen across many brands (sony, kodak, pentax, canon, and olympus)
Did I mention the lens? Killer resolution on both wide and telephoto modes
Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
Now, I am not a professional photographer by any means, and can't tell you any technical stuff, but this camera is AWESOME
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
The photos were blurry no matter how hard we tried to hold it still
Otherwise, it's a great camera
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
Almost Perfect
HD makes it a step above many others along with facial recognition and low light/nighttime controls
Wanted RED, who doesn't???  Found it here and love, love, love this camera
The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
1) It is perhaps too small.
With other cameras you hold down the button and it starts shooting (at whatever its shooting speed is such as 2
I will buy a mirror-less soon, but for the time being this is a great camera
It is compact and lightweight which makes a great take on trips
Takes great pictures
Makes very good pictures
I want it to take good pictures for me
Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said "oh my golly there is a continuous noise"
With this said, I am impressed at the quality of photo from this camera
After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
The Panasonic pictures are awesome, it's easy to use and has some great editing features
It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots
The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
I can barely turn on the TV anymore
good enough
AUTO video does a pretty decent job - there is a slight auto-focus noise as the camera focuses during video
But it doesn't have a flat front profile
It is also easier for me to hold my camera steady when using the viewfinder
VIDEOWow again
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
I also recently purchased a Panasonic Lumix TS5A, which is a compact waterproof point and shoot
20
Great camera no complaints
I also TOTALLY RECOMMEND getting the battery grip:Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release for Canon Rebel T2i, T3i, T4I, T5i,Digital SLR Cameras with 2 Extra LP-E8 Extended Life High Capacity Batteries, Wireless Infrared Remote and Lens Cleaning KitThey add so much to this camera as far as feel
Took about 60 pics and some video with 1 fully charged battery (still have some battery left)
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
In 2011, I returned for a 45 day trip
shutter sound5
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
This takes amazing quality photos on auto mode, has lots of settings
I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me
The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime
This has become my go-to for quick pictures, even though I have some more capable cameras available
I have had it about 40 days and am still in love with it
My experience is you get the best results in sunny weather and indoor with flash
Nikon Coolpix S8100
&#8230;
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
Does not have hdmi output
While there are enough automatic modes and settings to keep you busy learning until the unit is obsolete and it has to be replaced, the manual mode settings are limited
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
I can't wait for my next vacation
The screen is bright and clear and the movie feature is easy to use and takes awesome video
The Sony menus are a little tricky, but once you have learned how to use, you are good to go
I highly recommended
great
I'm nobody's photographer, but just about every shot I take with this camera comes out blurry
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
Basic features are intuitive and easily within reach
Easy menu and correct weight
It was worth every penny
The FZ200, however, costs $150 more than the FZ70, and it has its own weaknesses
Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
Oh well
The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
I had two Nikon DSLR's in the past, and they were just very complicated and very heavy for me to use all the time, this is fairly lightweight, and takes stunning photos
Also stock up on GOOD rechargeable batteries such Duracell
This little camera worked great
A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
It is not as small as my last camera but definitely more compact than my first
Drawbacks are as follows1- The HD movie you take its only good for downloading to PC and can only be watched in low definitation with direct cble to TV (no HDMI or component cable included)
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
Love this little camera
Since there is no in-camera panorama or panorama guide, the axial shift means a need to be conscientious about the framing and focal length choices
I liked that the mode dial appeared on the LCD when you changed settings
This camera goes from a super wide angle perfect for shooting in small rooms to zooming far away fast
This camera did not stand up to good quality photos
It was highly rated and true to the reviews
old school
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
Having a Leica lens makes it the Cadillac of point and shoots
The optical zoom isn't very good, its not exactly zooming in
Quality is a bit poor
Kool Camera
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
The prints would come out discolored and low quality
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
you will hear the little stabilization motors running when it is zoomed out
I'm not a professional but it sure feels close to being one for me
I did not like this camera very much
Spend three times the price and maybe it might be better
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
Photos were less sharp in many cases compared to some of my other cameras, mostly due to the aggressive noise reduction
Mine came with all these plug adapters for different countries, which may be useful for those that travel, but I just stored them in the junk drawer
This is one thing that a DSLR can't hope to do without an expensive lens just for it
I am not very techie  so I am still trying to figure out some things
I ordered this camera and accessories on the 1st and chose the free shipping because the camera was shown as "in stock" at Amazon
It's a brilliant camera, and if you see one available but it
They are selling this camera at such a lower price only because they want their customers to invest in their great lenses later
I've tried this and the results are great
i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
We both liked it so much that I bought another one for myself
Not small and thats a good thing
The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
I'm not a professional photographer and I'm on quite a learning curve at the moment; and totally thrilled to have a camera which does as much as this one does
Excellent camera
My photos are getting incredible
Lot of research
Takes excellent pictures and movies
This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
ZOOM Wow
This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
Since so many of the reviews mention it, I'll start by saying I don't use the video mode, I don't care about the video mode
You will be getting good use from them with this camera
very easy to use .
I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my husband, meant to be a replacement for a 5 year old Canon Powershot
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use
This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
I will be trying a FujiFilm FinePix T550 next, which sells for the same price but has a 12x zoom, and (I expect) better image stabilization
comfortable size and style
I can enlarge photos from my FZ200 and get a lot better results for the wildlife photos i take than this camera
the lowest price I could find for a repair was $200
Noise control seems well done at lower ISO's and is usually not noticeable in casual viewing
Ideal camera for sophisticated shutterbug
It's cheap and great for beginning photography
It has a very fast auto-focus
First camera she is reading the manual to see what else it can do
This camera doesn't fully satisfy my needs and I'm overall a little disappointed
I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
Great for vacationers
It's not working for me at all when I got the camera it was a picture on it I think someone returned it I need a full refund I can't even contact the seller
For example the Panasonic GF3 is often on sale, and in particular with the fantastic 14MM or 20MM pancake lens would give better image quality
COM LIKELY THINKS I'VE GONE STARK RAVING BONKERS - I GOT THIS & THREE OTHER CAMERAS IN A WEEKS TIME
Every picture turned out clear and the zoom option was nice although I didn't need it to zoom that close
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
Of course, packing more megapixels into the same sensor size causes less light to be collected by each pixel, but on the other hand, Canon stated this new one is a "High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor" and also a new noise-reduction algorithm works more effectively, so such a resolution leap should not cause any noticeable deterioration in IQ
I do wish it had the wifi capabilities like some newer models but this is a great option for beginners like me
I have 16 months old son who i took the best pictures of him with this incredible camera
What a great and useful feature
Therefore, the pictures I took with this camera were kind of just point, shoot and pray
Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing
I have been using a Canon EOS 7
I've only had this camera for a few days and am having a blast
I've had similar cameras and for the amount of photos I've taken I would have gone through 2-3 battery changes, and I'm still on the first set of batteries
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
Takes great pictures and videos
it didn't feel particularly sturdy, the screen images were not crisp as I thought they should be, too many negative write-ups by people that were expert in the field (which I am not)
It takes awesome still shots
Beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the photo quality
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
was a gift for teen  who just loves it
If you want a flexible, easy, point and shoot
I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for a while & received this one for Christmas
There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
And for the most part, despite what DxoMark and others say about it, it excels at this task
Best camera ever
if you are insterest in good pictures and don't have the skills to be a profesional taking pictures this s the camera you need
The pop up flash hasn't been a problem for me, but I can see how it would irritate some people
The adapter for these is always on the camera
It's a must have for our 10 top essentials for throwing amazing outdoor parties
But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature
As  I previous said it fits my hand well
JPG
BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
I also looked at the newer model just out of curiousity
You can also shoot stills while recording
I wound up with a Sony
Com but I felt the need to express how amazing this camera is
I have already received it and, so  far, I am getting great results for both purposes, familiy and work
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
-CMOS is AWESOME
I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed
Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part
So no putting this camera in the back pocket of tight jeans, which is something I want do often
Steady hand needed
Will make good pictures in low light situations and in total darkness if necessary
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
Really love this camera
Great camera with excellent features and easy to use
I have four (4) of them, all "basic" point and shoot
The EVF is full of noise and is tough to see when you are in focus, but the focus peaking feature really helps me judge when I'm sharp
I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
Highly recommended
I've been using the predecessors to this camera (the 260SX - 280SX) and this has one of the biggest bumps in performance and quality
It's got so many features I haven't tried them all as yet
Don't forget that, for those that complain about the quality from Any camera, it's a no-brainer
Better than expected
I don't think they are even in the same class so maybe this isn't a fair criticism
I was hoping for this digital Polaroid to have a better printing thatn the traditional, but it was not the case
Don't waste your money
So this new Canon camera is a very good compact device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording
as it was such a great concept
it is basically a nex in a slr body
Took wedding Video with ambient lighting colors were vibrant and at 1080PHD
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
Great camera
It bounced around in my bag, got knocked off the table a time or two, and overall wasn't treated as well as it should have been
Neat little camera
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
Bought it for before/after pics for my refinishing biz, does the job
My camera focus's by itself
Help
I've also played with the Continuous and timer modes to get some amazing full moon pictures
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
This camera takes crisp quality pictures
My Nex F3 was very good and takes great pictures, this is noticeably better
The setting most people will usually use is the iA setting and it is rather inconspicuous in size at least, on the mode dial/wheel
Certainly fine for this price range and intended uses
I wanted to replace my Coolpix P100 that is a GREAT camera
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
) is that you can choose which images you print out which means that you save paper and have better memories
I definitely recommend the 50mm linked above as it helps learning the manual controls of this camera
Camera startup is reasonably speedy, something less than 3 seconds from start/focus/take picture in low light ( faster outside)
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
I love using the L830 its easy and I enjoy using the built in effects
A sign of a good camera is its capability to take pictures in the dark
The image quality is amazing, and more importantly the focus time is much quicker than most cameras in this category
Our distance ranged from 1/3 to 3/4 miles from the racing craft and the zoom gave me exceptional photos
Does anyone else have a problem with edges
no needing to scan those tiny little pictures :)
I already own a digital SLR camera and a 300mm zoom lens, but this approximates 600mm optical (1200mm digital) zoom, which is amazing
I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
I didn't realize it came with it's own battery and a charger for it
I just had this beautiful camera delivered tonight
I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
DSLR's are just not in my budget with the lenses costing so much so I got this
Very happy with this camera
when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
The best thing about it is the light weight of it, pretty convenient to carry
The 60x zoom hand held pictures are amazing
the pictures are small but cute
I put in the extra memory chip, tho
It's just an amazing deal to get so much
Not really great
Very happy with this purchase, especially for $200
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
I wanted something a little more sophisticated than a point and shoot and this camera is terrific
A very nice camera
] 1 great example of the video quality and zoom quality of wildlife
Just a quick example: Last week during the full &#34;blood moon&#34; we had a great view of it here in California
My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
This is a great choice for $277, it's got a great zoom lens and takes clear photos
This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
With all the features The Pansonic has I can shoot in any condition
Camera looks nice  and the  zoom is  very nice
Note that the 3&#34; LCD view screen is not bad at all
APS-C chip, interchangeable lenses, hot shoe, 1/250th sync for flash, decent AF speed and accuracy in good light
Easy use and good pics
3), RAW, DPOF for photos, MPO for 3D and AVCHD and MP4 for movies- Photo resolution from 480x480 up to 4608x3456- Video from 640x480 to 1920x1080 at 30 fps- Tripod socket and flash horseshoe (there is a built-in flash, of course)- Relatively easy to navigate menus (must invest some time if you're a first time LUMIX user)- Nice image processing capabilities- Several levels of 'ease of use' from nearly full automatic to allowing you to set everything the way you want it
we probably are doing something wrong but have not figured it out yet
The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good
If you are shooting a lot of video with a DSLR, you'll probably want the T5i
The zoom? WOW I was really impressed
It works great
The FZ-70 packs a lot of features, including panoramic and RAW capabilities
It was well worth the wait for my red camera
NOW THIS CAMERA  IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES AND MOVIES ALSO WONDERFUL
Notice I said make better photos instead of take better photos that is because by learning how shutter speed and aperture work together you will be able to create photos where regular point-and-shoot cameras would fail
It is lightweight, small, takes fairly good photos, and looks cool, too
I did adjust a few of the setting for the auto mode to get increased consistency and more true to life images
Very happy with my purchase
And, with 3 kids - this is important because I waste a lot of shots
The viewer on the back Is a good 3 inches to view your subject but your photos also
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
Highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants a little extra with their camera
Unfortunately I ended up sending it back
The SX700 is a nice, full-featured but not-too-expensive, 2nd camera for this enthusiast
its the best ever
It meets my needs
I've had many cameras and this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST implementation of continuous shooting I have ever seen
HOW APERTURE AND SHUTTER SPEED WORK: (The following was taken from my 50mm lens review but it walks you through understanding shutter speed and aperture)Here I'll explain how the f-stop or aperture priority works on digital SLR cameras
It is easy to use and I would recommend it if you dont mind the size
If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 provides an awesome midpoint between an SLR and your typical point and shoot that was greatly being overlooked
The built in flash appears to be movable to simulate a 'bounce flash'
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
Had problems with noise and image quality
Just something to get used to
Perhaps that would happen with any camera though?I will keep using this camera and trying to learn how to maximize its capabilities
As a traveler and someone who frequently goes between regular view and zoom for variations of the same shot, a camera like this Lumix "all-in-one" continues the best camera to suit my needs because I don't have time or patience to switch lenses, and a lens that can handle regular to zoom on an SLR camera is easily a thousand dollars
I don't want to have to tweak a point-n-shoot
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy
Love This Camera
As a filmmaker, the video option is great to mess around with and, when viewed on a PC, are great quality
Build quality seems good
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
The equivalent of a "Blue Screen of Death" on Windows operating systems
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
It has been all that I read about and I am very satisfied with my selection
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
It's simple and basic, point shoot view
I love that the camera has a digital screen on the back not like the old polaroid cameras where you have to peek through a hole to see what you are photographing
Lots of Zoom
This camera is truely superb.
Panasonic stands out as an superb camera
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
Much better than my FZ150
I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
It's really fun to take pictures with
I have never owened a better camera
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
but it feels like a crutch
Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
The photo editing software that is included with it is also outstanding
Simply put - the BEST FOR YOUR MONEY
Additionally it has an effective anti-shake capability, making tripods for long shots not always necessary
Thankfully the store that I bought the camera was able to give me my Money Back
However, so far I am very happy using the new camera
This camera can do a lot of things that others cannot with such a low cost
If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom
If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy
Lens is capable enough too
this is an okay camera, but i feel that there are better out there
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
However, with Christmas shopping upon us, I have noticed some lower prices being advertised so check around for the best price before you purchase one as a local chain store might be less expensive
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
I also shot a few images at the horse show under the shade of trees and even in iA mode letting the camera pick all the settings and not zooming in at all, images were dark, mottled and grainy
It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance
Great Little Camera
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
Zoom is great, but be advised camera shake is multiplied when you have it on maximum zoom, so if you plan on taking lots of long distance shots I would invest in a tripod or monopod
This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
Another screen difference: the T5i swivel screen is better for video (swings out like a video camera
So hard to find the perfect camera, but am real happy with this one
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
I hope Canon fixes the GPS tagging app so it uses less battery on the phone
Easy to use
My FZ150 has a 25mm wide and this camera appears to take in approx
However this review is about the camera and it is a good camera for a beginner or a travel camera
I priced it at other stores, and Amazon beat them by $100
This camera has far superior clarity in still pictures compared to the Fujifilm S8200 and when filming in HD, this camera has no interlacing issues when moving the camera like the Fujifilm S8200
Just What We Wanted
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
Another unfortunate feature is that the proprietary charging cable is lost (as in my case), there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get one - I imagine I will have to call Polaroid because the cable is not available on Amazon or the Polaroid website
You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY
This camera is so easy to use!
I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
I am very happy with my purchase
-Comes with some rad software to help with editing
Things in general are fast, except for two problems which I discuss below
Anyone who has used a digital camera made in the last three years wont have any issues with it at all
This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens
We took only 3 shots, and the streaks just got worse
Bought this for a conference event
I have just started using it and so far, it is very user friendly
After going to 4 stores, comparing cameras and prices, I decided to go on Amazon
I purchased this camera after my Nikon Coolpix S8200 broke down on me again for the second time
The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video
I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
Oh and I love the deep red color
These do not affect the resulting photos and videos
Boy was I wrong
